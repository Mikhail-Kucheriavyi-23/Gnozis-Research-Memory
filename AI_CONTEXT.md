## RESEARCH LIBRARY ROLE — 2026-09-21

This repository is the Gnozis Research Library: the public research/archive line containing discovered principles, reverse-analysis, mathematical models, experimental Python implementations and research material for researchers and enthusiasts. It is not the current production Core. Gnozis-V2 is the future canonical engineering Core foundation.

Research findings may become V2 requirements only after pattern extraction, definition/formalization, engineering mapping and evidence. Historical code in this repository is not automatically canonical V2 implementation.

Intended lineage: Research Library → Gnozis Core → specialized research kernels → user/commercial versions.

# AI_CONTEXT.md — Gnozis Strategic Mathematical Context
## 2026-09-18 consolidation

This file records the strategic and mathematical conclusions established during the current analytical phase. It is not a claim that every statement below is proven. Distinguish: definition, candidate derivation, implementation fact, empirical result, and hypothesis.

## 1. Strategic foundation

Gnozis is not to be designed by accumulating software modules and then fitting mathematics afterward. The direction is reversed:

Natural mathematical structure
-> laws/constraints
-> computable representation
-> architecture
-> implementation
-> verification
-> empirical experiments.

The target is a natural and efficient mathematical architecture, not a maximally complex architecture.

A useful engineering criterion is:

Minimum primitives -> maximum derived structure.

Do not add a primitive entity if it can be derived from lower-level structure.

The real-world model is treated as recursively structured; this is a design/philosophical premise to be mathematically investigated, not a license to assert unproven physical claims.

Panpsychist/philosophical ideas may guide the research direction, but Core must distinguish philosophical interpretation from mathematical proof and empirical verification.

## 2. Core candidate ontology

Primary candidate:

Psi = (X, R)

X = elements/structures.
R = relations between elements.

For finite representations, R may be represented by one or more relation matrices, but the matrix representation is an implementation of the relational structure, not necessarily the fundamental ontology.

Candidate general relation form:

R subset of X x X x K

where K can encode relation type.

An element x in X may itself have recursive structure of the same mathematical class. Therefore Agent, World, Memory, Knowledge, etc. should not automatically be fundamental classes.

## 3. State and immutability

State must remain the single source of truth for Psi.

Do not introduce a second hidden state model.

Psi_t = (X_t, R_t).

Transitions must produce a new state; old states must remain deeply immutable. Frozen dataclasses alone are insufficient if nested mutable objects remain reachable.

R must be a first-class evolving component. The model must permit:
- X' = X with R' != R
- X' != X with R' = R
- X' != X and R' != R
- R' = empty when permitted.

## 4. Laws and admissibility

Do not put every law into Psi by default.

Candidate separation:

Psi = structure
L = admissibility/laws
T_L = transition dynamics compatible with L.

Basic admissible future set:

A_L(Psi) = { Psi' | L(Psi, Psi') = 1 }

Core transition is therefore not necessarily a single deterministic F(Psi). The state may have multiple admissible futures:

Psi_{t+1} in A_L(Psi_t).

Selection must never create an inadmissible state.

Selection and value are not fundamental until shown necessary.

## 5. Invariants

Separate:
- invariant properties;
- variable properties;
- derived quantities.

Do not make everything invariant, because that would prevent evolution.

Candidate preservation condition:

I(Psi_{t+1}) = I(Psi_t)

for invariants that truly define organizational identity.

Safety, logical validity, identity, etc. are candidates for constraints/invariants rather than scalar scores.

## 6. Evolution and recursion

Ordinary evolution:

(Psi_t, L_t) -> (Psi_{t+1}, L_t)

Meta-evolution/self-evolution:

(Psi_t, L_t) -> (Psi_{t+1}, L_{t+1})

The second is the meaningful higher-order self-evolution problem: changing the state and/or the space of possible transformations.

Proof-preserving evolution candidate:

L_t |- Valid(L_{t+1})
and
L_t |- Invariant(Psi_{t+1})

A new law must not simply be accepted because an AI proposed it.

Software self-modification and mathematical evolution are separate layers:
mathematical evolution -> validated law/behavior -> software implementation -> verification.

## 7. Recursion and scale

Potential recursive structure:

x in X may itself be a structure (X_x, R_x).

Relations can exist:
- between elements;
- between substructures;
- potentially between relations or higher-order structures.

Do not introduce separate Agent/World classes unless analysis shows they are irreducible.

Candidate derived agent:

A subset A of X that is relatively internally organized, causally bounded, dynamically persistent, and interacts with the surrounding structure through a boundary of relations.

Candidate world:

W = (X_W, R_W), i.e. a structure of the same mathematical family.

World A and World B should be different instances/constraints/observation contexts, not separate hard-coded engines.

## 8. Observation, information, memory, knowledge

Observation:

O: Psi -> Y

An observation y restricts possible states:

Omega_y = {Psi in Omega | O(Psi) = y}

Candidate information interpretation:

Information = reduction/restriction of the space of possible states.

Observation can therefore restrict admissible futures:

A_y(Psi) subseteq A(Psi).

Memory is not merely a database. Candidate operational definition:

Memory exists when past information has a persistent causal effect on future dynamics.

A testable condition is that, holding other relevant conditions fixed, future behavior differs depending on whether prior information was retained.

Knowledge is stronger than memory: candidate definition is information incorporated into generative constraints/admissibility.

Do not collapse raw observation, memory, and knowledge into one object.

## 9. Different realities / World A and World B

Different observations need not imply different underlying structures.

O_A(Psi) may differ from O_B(Psi).

Thus different realities can be modeled as different observation/constraint contexts over a common mathematical core.

When two sources produce constraints C_A and C_B:
- compatible case: A(C_A) intersection A(C_B) is nonempty;
- incompatible case: the intersection may be empty.

Do not force an artificial compromise when constraints are incompatible. Incompatibility itself is information.

This is a key mathematical route for collective integration of different realities.

## 10. Tension and creativity

Candidate structural tension:

tau = a measure of incompatibility/difference between constraints, structures, or admissible spaces.

Do NOT assume that the universal objective is tau -> 0.

Persistent or increased tension may create a richer structure.

Important candidate distinction:

Ordinary optimization:
choose x inside an existing admissible space A_t.

Higher-order creativity:
transform the structure so that A_t itself changes.

Candidate formulation:

Creativity = structural transformation of the solution/admissible space, not merely better selection inside a fixed space.

A genuinely new solution may be a state that was unavailable under A_t but becomes admissible under A_{t+1}.

This is a candidate hypothesis to test, not yet a theorem.

## 11. Agents, multi-agent behavior, trust

Agenthood should preferably emerge as a structural property of a substructure, rather than be hard-coded as a primitive.

Multi-agent behavior can then arise from multiple persistent substructures A_i within a common relational system.

Trust should preferably be derived from historical evidence/consistency relations rather than made a primitive scalar.

Candidate:
Trust(a,b) = f(consistency, evidence, history, context)

The exact form must be derived/tested later.

Gnozis interacting with users and Gnozis creating capabilities for user copies should use the same underlying relational/agent model rather than separate special-purpose ontologies.

## 12. Time and causality

Avoid requiring a global clock in Core.

The index t can be an ordering of transformations rather than an externally imposed universal clock.

Candidate causal structure:
Psi_a precedes Psi_b when a is a dependency/causal prerequisite for b.

A partial order may be more fundamental than global time for distributed/multi-agent evolution.

## 13. Candidate variational direction

Do not yet declare a final formula.

Candidate classes to compare:
A. relational dynamics: Psi_{t+1} = F(Psi_t)
B. matrix dynamics: M_{t+1} = Phi(M_t)
C. operator dynamics: Psi_{t+1} = T_Psi(Psi_t)
D. variational dynamics: delta S = 0
E. constrained variational dynamics: delta S = 0 with C_i = 0
F. recursive relational dynamics involving R, transformations of R, and higher-order relations.

Potential unified transition:

Psi_{t+1} in Ext_{Psi' in A_L(Psi_t)} E(Psi_t, Psi')

Use Ext deliberately rather than prematurely assuming min/max.

A functional E must not simply be invented as a fitness score. The research goal is to determine whether E can be derived from structure, information, invariants, or constraints.

Potentially important alternative:
minimum sufficient structural change subject to required constraints.

But this remains a candidate, not a final law.

## 14. Optimality criterion for the mathematical model

Do not define optimality as mathematical complexity or number of features.

Candidate model selection criterion:

M* = argmin_M Complexity(M)

subject to M satisfying the required structural properties.

A useful informal compression criterion:

K(M) = Complexity(M) - DerivedCapability(M)

Seek a low-K model while preserving required properties.

The desired result is not a magical single equation chosen by taste. It is a minimal mathematical principle from which the necessary equations and architecture can be derived.

## 15. 14 current requirements for candidate models

A candidate fundamental model should be tested for:
1. structurality
2. relationality
3. X-change
4. R-change
5. recursion
6. admissibility/constraints
7. invariants
8. branching
9. emergence
10. self-maintenance
11. observability
12. mathematical verifiability
13. compositionality
14. recursive/self-similar or scale behavior

A candidate that satisfies only some of these is not automatically the final model.

## 16. Current core hypothesis

The strongest current candidate minimal chain is:

Psi = (X,R)
-> observation O
-> information as restriction of possibilities
-> constraints/admissibility A_L(Psi)
-> tension from incompatibility
-> structural transformation
-> new Psi
while preserving required invariants.

Meta-evolution adds:
L_t -> L_{t+1}, subject to proof-preserving validation.

This is a research scaffold, not a final theorem.

## 17. What must NOT happen

Do not:
- add AI models into mathematical Core;
- turn every concept into a class;
- introduce a global selector as an oracle;
- assume fitness is fundamental;
- assume minimizing tension is universally correct;
- confuse empirical behavior with mathematical proof;
- claim the model proves a physical/panpsychist worldview;
- use World A/B as hard-coded special engines;
- allow self-modification to bypass validation;
- treat a database as proof of memory;
- treat an LLM's generated output as proof of mathematical validity.

## 18. Immediate research program while repository access is constrained

Before implementation, derive and compare:
1. information from distinguishability/restriction of possibility;
2. memory as persistent causal influence;
3. knowledge as incorporation into generative constraints;
4. tension as incompatibility of constraints/admissible spaces;
5. creativity as transformation of the admissible space;
6. agenthood as a persistent relational substructure;
7. worldhood as a structure/context of the same family;
8. trust as a derived evidence relation;
9. causality as dependency/partial order;
10. autopoiesis as preservation of organization under structural change;
11. meta-evolution as proof-preserving transformation of laws;
12. a candidate variational/structural principle unifying selection, stability and evolution.

For every result mark it as:
DEFINITION / DERIVATION / THEOREM-CANDIDATE / IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT / EMPIRICAL TEST / OPEN QUESTION.

## 19. Strategic principle

Gnozis should aim to reproduce the organization of natural mathematical systems rather than imitate their surface complexity.

The central engineering question is:
What is the smallest lawful recursive structure from which the observed higher-level capabilities can naturally emerge?

Do not optimize the architecture before answering this question.

## 20. New analytical conclusions — 2026-09-18

### 20.1 Transformation space should be derived, not necessarily stored

Define the lawful future set from the law:

T_L(Psi) = {Psi' in P | L(Psi,Psi') = 1}

Therefore T_L may be a derived construction rather than a primitive Core object.

The fundamental candidate can remain:

Psi = (X,R)
plus an admissibility relation/law L.

### 20.2 Evolution as a path through structural space

Let P be the space of valid structures. A transition is a path gamma from Psi to Psi'. A possible structural cost is:

D(Psi,Psi') = inf_gamma Cost(gamma).

This is only a candidate metric/cost, but it suggests that structural distance should be based on the minimum transformation required to move between structures rather than an arbitrary coordinate distance.

Potential identity relation:

Psi ~ Psi' when they preserve the required organizational invariant, even if their concrete X and R differ.

Therefore:
same organizational identity != same state.

### 20.3 Discrete variational candidate

For a sequence:

Psi_0,...,Psi_n

candidate action:

S[Psi_0,...,Psi_n] = sum_k F(Psi_k,Psi_{k+1})

with an extremal admissible path:

gamma* = Ext_{gamma in Gamma_L} S[gamma].

Do not assume min/max or a specific F until it is derived or empirically justified.

### 20.4 Information as restriction of transformation possibilities

An observation y need not only reduce possible states. It can reduce the set of possible future transformations:

T_y(Psi) subseteq T(Psi).

Candidate interpretation:

Information = restriction/distinguishability of possible transformations.

A later structural reorganization may expand lawful possibilities again.

### 20.5 Creativity as lawful expansion of invariant-preserving possibilities

Candidate:

T^I(Psi) = {tau in T_L(Psi) | I(tau(Psi)) = I(Psi)}

A candidate creative transformation expands the lawful invariant-preserving transformation space:

T^I_{new} properly contains T^I_{old}.

This is not a theorem. It is a testable definition candidate.

Important distinction:
Novelty != Evolution.
More possibilities alone are not sufficient; organization and law must be preserved.

### 20.6 Self-evolution as evolution of transformation space

Ordinary evolution:
Psi_t -> Psi_{t+1}.

Higher-order evolution:
T_{L_t}(Psi_t) -> T_{L_{t+1}}(Psi_{t+1}).

Thus self-evolution is not synonymous with self-editing code. It is a mathematical change in the system's lawful space of possible transformations, followed by validated implementation.

### 20.7 World A/B as constraint and observation contexts

World A and B can be modeled through:
O_A(Psi), O_B(Psi)
and/or
L_A, L_B.

Compare:
T_A intersection T_B
T_A minus T_B
T_B minus T_A.

If a common admissible region exists, integration can preserve it. If constraints are incompatible, the incompatibility itself is information.

A candidate collective synthesis C should be sought where its lawful transformation space is compatible with required constraints and may, in successful cases, contain structures unavailable to either source independently.

Do not implement World A/B as special engines.

### 20.8 Tension as empty or reduced admissible intersection

For constraints L_A and L_B:

A_AB(Psi) = A_A(Psi) intersection A_B(Psi).

Strong incompatibility occurs when:

A_AB(Psi) = empty.

Partial tension occurs when the overlap is nonempty but significantly restricted.

Do not make tau -> 0 the universal objective.

### 20.9 Observation, memory, knowledge as derived layers

Let external structure be E and interaction relations connect Psi with E.

Observation is induced by accessible relations.

Memory exists when an observation produces a persistent relation that changes later reachable futures.

Knowledge is stronger: persistent information becomes part of validated generative constraints/admissibility.

Therefore:
database persistence != mathematical memory;
stored data != knowledge.

### 20.10 Agent, World and Multi-agent behavior as structural predicates

An Agent may be a persistent, internally organized substructure with a boundary of relations and causal activity.

A World may be a dynamical structure of the same family.

Multi-agent behavior may emerge from multiple persistent substructures in one relational system.

Avoid making these fundamental ontology classes until irreducibility is demonstrated.

### 20.11 Trust as evidence-derived relation

Prefer storing evidence/history relations and deriving trust from them rather than treating trust as a primitive scalar.

Candidate:
Trust(A,B) = f(evidence, consistency, history, context).

The exact f remains open.

### 20.12 Time and causality may be derived

No global clock is required for the mathematical core.

A transition ordering or causal dependency relation may generate the relevant temporal order.

For distributed systems, partial order may be more fundamental than a universal scalar time.

### 20.13 Law may itself be emergent regularity

A major open question is:

Can L be derived from R?

Observed transitions form D = {(Psi_i,Psi_i')}.

A repeated relation P may be:
- observed regularity;
- validated conditional law;
- mathematically necessary law.

Do not collapse these levels.

Candidate conditional law:
L = (C,P), where C is the applicability domain and P the transition relation.

A law should not be promoted from observation to necessity without counterexample search and/or proof.

### 20.14 Closure is an architectural criterion

If a new concept cannot be derived from the existing mathematical vocabulary without adding an unrelated special subsystem, this is evidence that the foundation may be incomplete.

Candidate closure test:

(X,R,L)
=> Observation
=> Information
=> Memory
=> Knowledge
=> Agent
=> World
=> Trust
=> Tension
=> Creativity
=> Autopoiesis
=> Self-evolution.

This is a research test, not a claim that all derivations are already proven.

### 20.15 Minimal transition candidate

A compact candidate process is:

Psi
-> interaction/constraint C
-> admissible set A(Psi,C)
-> if A = empty: STOP
-> otherwise choose/search Psi' in A
-> verify invariant I(Psi,Psi')
-> transition Psi -> Psi'
-> update relational structure.

This gives a mathematical interpretation of hard stop:
if no admissible transition exists, the system must not invent one.

### 20.16 Creativity under tension

When existing constraints are incompatible, the system need not choose A or B immediately.

Candidate higher-order operation:

L_A, L_B
-> discover structural transformation L_C or Psi_C
-> restore a nonempty lawful solution space
-> preserve required invariants.

This is a candidate mathematical model of creative resolution of contradiction.

### 20.17 Mathematical architecture must be derived before implementation

The current repository must not be treated as proof that the present architecture is mathematically optimal.


## 27. Analytical consolidation XLII–XLIV — 2026-09-18

This section preserves the mathematical conclusions reached after the previous consolidation. These are research candidates unless explicitly marked otherwise.

### 27.1 Identity should be an equivalence class, not literal state equality

For evolving structures, require neither:

Psi_{t+1} = Psi_t

nor preservation of the exact same X and R.

Candidate organizational identity:

Psi_t ~= Psi_{t+1}

when the required organizational invariants are preserved under an admissible transformation.

Thus:

same organization != same concrete state.

### 27.2 The fundamental object may be the admissible transformation law

Let T be the space of potential transformations and A_* the admissible subset:

A_* subseteq T.

A transition is lawful when:

f in A_*.

The important insight is that the foundation may lie less in the current state and more in the rules governing permissible transformations.

Candidate decomposition:

I -> C -> Psi

where:
I = minimal immutable/fundamental constraints;
C = structures and admissible transformations;
Psi = current concrete state.

Do not prematurely implement these as files/classes. This is a mathematical decomposition first.

### 27.3 Category-like closure is a candidate formal structure

For:

f: Psi_0 -> Psi_1
g: Psi_1 -> Psi_2

composition gives:

g o f: Psi_0 -> Psi_2.

Identity:

id_Psi: Psi -> Psi.

Therefore the family of structures and admissible transformations has category-like closure.

Do not yet assert that Gnozis "is a category"; the useful result is that objects, admissible transformations, identity and composition form a natural mathematical vocabulary for evolution.

### 27.4 Evolution is directional and need not be reversible

An evolution step may be:

Psi_t -> Psi_{t+1}

without an inverse transformation.

Therefore a group structure is unnecessarily restrictive. A more general compositional transformation structure is appropriate.

No global clock is required. A history can be represented by ordered transition edges:

(Psi_i, f_i, Psi_{i+1}).

### 27.5 Persistence is history of transformations, not merely stored states

A persistence layer should preserve enough information to reconstruct/verify:

Psi_0 -> Psi_1 -> ... -> Psi_n

with transition evidence.

Database storage alone is not mathematical memory. Persistent information becomes memory only when it has a demonstrable causal effect on later reachable futures.

### 27.6 Transformation-space expansion is a stronger evolution signal

Let:

F(Psi) = set of lawful reachable futures.

For a transition:

Psi -> Psi'

define:

N = F(Psi') \ F(Psi)
L = F(Psi) \ F(Psi')
S = F(Psi) intersection F(Psi').

Then:

N = new reachable possibilities;
L = lost reachable possibilities;
S = retained possibilities.

This gives a structural description of evolution without reducing it to an arbitrary scalar reward.

A candidate higher-order creative event is:

F(Psi') properly contains F(Psi)

subject to preservation of required invariants and lawfulness.

Novelty alone is not value, evolution, or creativity.

### 27.7 Cost should remain separate from value

A candidate structural transition cost may be:

K(Psi -> Psi').

Do not immediately combine K with novelty or preservation into a single invented score.

The candidate evaluation object is a structured vector such as:

V = (preservation, new_possibilities, lost_possibilities, cost, evidence).

Different candidates may remain incomparable.

This supports partial orders rather than a universal selector.

### 27.8 Selection need not be a primitive oracle

After generation and verification, several candidates may remain admissible:

C_valid = {Psi'_1, Psi'_2, ...}.

It is mathematically legitimate to preserve multiple branches rather than force one global winner.

A selector, if later required by an application, belongs above the fundamental Core unless analysis proves otherwise.

### 27.9 Structural naturalness

A candidate transition f: Psi -> Psi' can be considered structurally natural relative to the model when it is:

Admissible(f)
and Traceable(f)
and InvariantPreserving(f).

This is a formal candidate for "natural fit"; it is not a claim about universal natural law.

### 27.10 Creativity as transformation of the admissible space

Ordinary optimization searches inside a fixed admissible space.

Higher-order creativity changes the space itself.

Candidate:

T_old^I(Psi) = invariant-preserving lawful transformations before the structural reorganization.

A candidate creative transformation produces a new lawful space:

T_new^I(Psi)

with:

T_old^I(Psi) properly contained in T_new^I(Psi).

This captures the strategic engineering intuition that a powerful design can create additional future design possibilities rather than merely optimize one fixed design.

### 27.11 User goals must remain outside the mathematical Core

The Core can determine:

what structures are admissible;
what transformations are possible;
what invariants are preserved;
what consequences follow.

A user/application layer can determine:

what is wanted in a particular context.

Therefore:

Core = lawful possibility;
Application = contextual objective;
World = empirical consequence.

Do not encode a universal human value function into the mathematical Core.

### 27.12 Counterexample results from XLIV

Several structural operations can be derived or checked directly from Psi=(X,R):

- X addition/removal;
- R addition/removal;
- combined structural mutation;
- type/source/target consistency;
- relation closure where a specified Gamma permits it.

A general mutation can be normalized as:

DeltaX+ = X' \ X
DeltaX- = X \ X'
DeltaR+ = R' \ R
DeltaR- = R \ R'

with:

X' = (X \ DeltaX-) union DeltaX+
R' = (R \ DeltaR-) union DeltaR+.

This is a useful canonical representation of a candidate transition, not yet the final mutation API.

### 27.13 Derived laws versus axiomatic laws

Not every admissibility rule can be derived from raw R.

Separate:

A_derived(Psi) = structural consequences of the current relational structure;

A_axiom = minimal externally specified mathematical constraints.

Then:

A(Psi) = A_axiom intersection A_derived(Psi).

This avoids the false claim that every law of the system must somehow emerge from the current data alone.

### 27.14 Relation closure must not be silently assumed

If:

a R b
and
b R c

then a R c only if the relation semantics include the corresponding transitivity/closure rule.

Therefore a closure operator Gamma_R is a candidate law:

R+ = Cl_GammaR(R).

The implementation must not smuggle semantic assumptions into a graph/database representation.

### 27.15 Multi-valued transition dynamics

A deterministic map:

Psi_{t+1} = F(Psi_t)

is only one special case.

A more general candidate is:

Gamma(Psi,E) -> C

where C is a set of candidate successor structures.

After verification:

Psi' in C_valid.

This preserves branching and avoids a hidden universal selector.

### 27.16 Verification layers

A candidate transition should distinguish at least:

T_I = invariant/axiom verification;
T_S = structural consistency;
T_P = provenance/proof verification;
T_E = external empirical verification.

Core can formalize the first three where the corresponding mathematics exists.

T_E may require the external world, experiment, simulation, manufacturing, user feedback, or another observation channel.

Therefore:

mathematical proof of a model != proof that the physical world behaves exactly as the model predicts.

### 27.17 Self-modification boundary

State evolution:

Psi_t -> Psi_{t+1}

is different from law/capability evolution:

L_t -> L_{t+1}

or:

T_t -> T_{t+1}.

Changing code is only an implementation event. It is not itself evidence of mathematical self-evolution.

A stronger verification boundary is required when the system changes the mechanism that performs verification itself.

### 27.18 Current unified mathematical candidate

The current compact chain is:

Psi_t = (X_t,R_t)
-> interaction/observation/constraint C_t
-> admissible transformation set T_t
-> candidate transformation tau_t
-> verification
-> Psi_{t+1} = tau_t(Psi_t)
-> append-only evidence/history
-> recompute T_{t+1}
-> determine whether state, capability space, or law changed.

Hard stop:

if T_t = empty, no invented transition is allowed.

Higher-order self-evolution:

T_{t+1} != T_t

when the change results from an internally generated and validated structural/lawful transformation.

### 27.19 Next analytical block XLV

The next calculation must formalize the boundary between the system and external structure:

Boundary(Psi)

and derive, from one common model:

Input / Output
Observation
Action
Feedback
User interaction
Internet/world exploration
Multi-agent interaction.

The objective is to avoid separate mathematical engines for Internet Bridge, User Bridge, Multi-Agent, Memory and World interaction.

After XLV, compare four deeper closure families:

1. recursive/fixed-point closure;
2. variational dynamics;
3. symmetry/conservation structures;
4. algebraic/category-theoretic closure.

The comparison criterion remains:

find the smallest mathematically coherent generative architecture capable of expressing state, relation, law, constraint, branching, emergence, self-maintenance and validated self-evolution.

### 27.20 Working rule for all future analysis

Do not retrofit mathematics to existing repository code.

Required order:

mathematical derivation
-> counterexample
-> minimal specification
-> mapping to current code
-> implementation change
-> verification.

Existing code is implementation history, not proof of mathematical optimality.


## 28. Missing analytical context preserved — LXXVIII–LXXXI — 2026-09-18

This section explicitly preserves the analytical work that must not be lost between AI sessions. It is research context, not a claim that every item is implemented or mathematically proven.

### 28.1 Inter-Gnozis network: connected but independently authoritative

A Gnozis instance is modeled as:

G_i = (Psi_i, K_i, M_i)

A network contains:

{G_1, G_2, ..., G_n}

Connectivity must not imply shared state:

Connectivity != Shared State.

A remote instance never directly writes another instance's authoritative Core state.

Remote interaction is represented as a protocol message:

m = (sender, receiver, type, payload, provenance, proof, policy, integrity).

Remote messages become inputs/candidates/evidence and must pass the receiving instance's local verification and commit boundary.

Invariant:

RemoteMessage_ij does not directly imply Mutation(Psi_j).

### 28.2 Distributed verification without distributed authority

A network may distribute verification:

G_1 generates a candidate;
G_2 checks structural properties;
G_3 checks a mathematical invariant;
G_4 checks an external source.

But the receiving/local Gnozis retains commit authority.

Distributed verification != distributed authority.

ForeignProof => Evidence, not Authority.

ForeignTrust => InteractionSignal, not CommitPermission.

A trusted peer still cannot bypass the local kernel verification boundary.

### 28.3 Identity, capability and authenticity

Identity must not be confused with authority:

Identity != Authority.

A cryptographic identity may be represented by a public key or a derived identifier. Signatures provide authenticity/integrity of a message, not truth of its contents:

Signature != Truth.

Capabilities describe what an instance can demonstrate it can do. Capability claims themselves should have provenance/evidence. Capability negotiation is separate from truth verification.

Compatibility(Cap_i, Cap_j) may determine whether two instances can meaningfully cooperate.

### 28.4 Claims, evidence and conflict

A complete external claim can be represented as:

Q_i = (q_i, Context_i, Evidence_i, Proof_i).

A receiving instance may classify it as:

Verified / Unverified / Contradicted / Incompatible / Unknown.

Unknown != Contradicted.
Incompatible != False.

A challenge protocol may request provenance, reproduction, proof, or additional evidence.

Conflict should be recorded rather than silently erased:

ConflictRecord = (Claim_A, Claim_B, Context_A, Context_B, Evidence_A, Evidence_B).

Possible outcomes include:
Resolve;
Refine;
Partition;
Preserve.

An unresolved conflict is a state of knowledge, not necessarily a system failure.

### 28.5 Different realities and interoperability

Interoperability should permit:

understanding without forced agreement.

A claim may be interpretable in another context without being accepted there:

Compatibility != Agreement.

A RealityProfile may describe ontology, rules, units, assumptions and capabilities without asserting universal truth.

This supports the original different-realities objective without creating hard-coded World A/World B engines.

### 28.6 Proposal, merge, fork and clone lineage

A remote proposal:

p: Psi_j -> Psi_j'

is a proposal, not an instruction.

Receiver choices may include:
Accept;
Reject;
Modify;
Fork;
RequestMoreEvidence.

Merge must first create a MergeCandidate and pass compatibility/conflict/proof checks.

Merge = Candidate, not Authority.

Cloning should create connected lineage rather than isolated copies:

Clone(G_i) = G_j
Parent(G_j) = ID_i
Clone = SharedLineage + IndependentState.

A fork creates descendants that preserve ancestry without requiring identical future states.

Lineage may therefore be represented as an evolutionary DAG.

### 28.7 Encrypted communication

Network communication needs independent properties:

Confidentiality;
Authenticity;
Integrity.

Encryption protects contents. Signing authenticates origin/integrity. Neither proves truth.

Network negotiation must be resource bounded. A communication/session budget prevents unbounded challenge-response loops.

Silence at a mandatory verification gate is not consent:

Silence = HardStop.

### 28.8 User <-> Gnozis and multi-agent symmetry

A user may act as:
Observer;
Generator;
EvidenceProvider;
Evaluator.

A Gnozis may use multiple users as distributed agents, while users may use multiple Gnozis as agents.

The same underlying relation/agent model should be preferred over separate special-purpose ontologies.

User input, another Gnozis, an AI model, Internet evidence, or an agent may generate candidates or evidence, but none automatically receives Core commit authority.

UserPreference != KernelAuthority.

### 28.9 Assimilation pipeline

External structure E interacts with Psi through observations and relations.

The canonical assimilation pipeline is:

Observation
-> Interpretation
-> Candidate
-> Verification
-> Assimilation
-> State.

Observation does not imply assimilation.

Evidence may be assimilated without accepting the associated claim.

Evidence assimilation != Knowledge assimilation.

Knowledge is stronger than raw observation/memory: it becomes part of validated generative constraints/admissibility.

### 28.10 Layered memory

Memory should distinguish at least:

M_obs = observation memory;
M_evidence = evidence/provenance memory;
M_knowledge = validated knowledge;
M_history = evolution/history.

Memory is not merely a database. A mathematical candidate definition is:

Memory exists when retained information has a persistent causal effect on future dynamics.

Database persistence != mathematical memory.
Stored data != knowledge.

### 28.11 Psi remains authoritative; SQLite is persistence/serialization

Psi = (X,R) remains the logical source of truth.

SQLite is a persistence representation, not a second authoritative state model:

Psi -> serialization -> SQLite
SQLite -> recovery/verification -> Psi'.

Recovery must verify integrity before evolution resumes.

If integrity cannot be verified, the instance may enter quarantine:

State readable, but evolution unauthorized.

### 28.12 Identity across evolution and recovery

Instance identity should be lineage-based rather than equal to a literal state.

A conceptual identity may contain:

RootID;
Lineage;
CryptographicIdentity.

Same instance across restart requires verified continuity of lineage/integrity.

A descendant can share RootID while having a different lineage.

Unrelated instances have different roots.

Organizational identity may survive concrete state change when required organizational invariants remain preserved.

### 28.13 Self-modification lattice

Self-modification is not one operation. Candidate levels:

L0 Data
L1 Knowledge
L2 Strategy
L3 Generator
L4 Policy
L5 Protocol
L6 Kernel.

Higher levels require stronger containment and verification.

Changing a generator must not automatically change the verifier.
Changing a policy must not automatically remove safety constraints.
Changing a protocol must preserve explicit compatibility/versioning.
Kernel self-modification is a separate meta-evolution class.

### 28.14 Candidate self-modification lifecycle

For ordinary mutable mechanisms:

Propose
-> Sandbox
-> Verify
-> Shadow
-> Canary
-> Promote
-> Commit

with rollback available.

A new mechanism must first exist as an object of evaluation, not immediately become active.

Self-modification must not grant itself additional privilege:

CodeEvolution != PrivilegeEvolution.

Candidate permission expansion is a separate transition.

### 28.15 Immutable safety/verification boundary

The safety/verification boundary should contain, at minimum, candidates for:

State integrity;
Commit semantics;
Proof verification;
Resource/gas accounting;
Emergency stop;
Lineage integrity.

The precise immutable boundary remains a design subject to formal verification.

Critical invariant:

No self-modification may remove or bypass the mechanism required to verify that self-modification.

EmergencyStop should not be ordinary self-modifiable policy.

### 28.16 Gas-limited autonomous and meta-evolution

Ordinary evolution and self-modification must be resource bounded.

A conceptual cost can include:

Cost = BaseCost + DepthCost + VerificationCost.

Per-cycle depth and operation budgets prevent recursive explosion:

G -> G' -> G'' -> ...

No unbounded autonomous negotiation or self-modification.

Evolution is permitted, not mandatory.

### 28.17 Endogenous selection without an external selector

The old Generate -> Test -> Select -> Evolve chain is preserved without introducing a selector oracle.

Generate produces:

C_t = {c_1, ..., c_n}.

Test/verification produces:

C_valid = {c in C_t | Valid(c)=1}.

Selection is a relation/function returning a set of admissible candidates, not a winner-producing actor:

Sel : (Psi, C, K, B) -> P(C).

Selection can be decomposed into:

Validity != Selection != Scheduling.

Validity asks whether a candidate is lawful.
Selection identifies admissible continuation candidates.
Scheduling determines which admissible candidates can be executed now under resource limits.

### 28.18 Partial orders instead of universal scalar fitness

When multiple candidates are admissible, do not invent a universal score merely to force a winner.

Candidates may be incomparable:

c_1 || c_2.

A partial order may encode documented dominance where justified.

Incomparable valid candidates may be:
- retained as branches;
- deferred;
- scheduled later;
- compared after additional evidence.

Resource selection is not truth selection.

If only one branch can be executed for resource reasons, a deterministic canonical tie-break may be used for reproducibility, but it must not be interpreted as a truth claim.

### 28.19 Defer and branch are legitimate outcomes

Selection results may include:

Accept;
Reject;
Defer;
Branch.

If no valid candidate exists:

NoValidTransition.

This is not necessarily failure. The system may remain unchanged:

Psi_{t+1} = Psi_t.

Hard stop applies when no admissible transition exists or a mandatory verification gate is unresolved.

Evolution is permitted, not mandatory.

### 28.20 Selection as a transition-system property

A stronger formulation is:

T : (Psi, E, K, B) -> P(Psi)

rather than a deterministic universal map.

The transition system defines the space of admissible successors. A trajectory is one path through that space.

Selection is therefore a property of the transition system, not an external decision-maker.

### 28.21 Candidate evaluation structure

Avoid collapsing all evaluation into an invented scalar score.

A candidate may be represented by structured properties such as:

V = (preservation, new_possibilities, lost_possibilities, cost, evidence).

Candidate validity may require:

Invariant(c) = 1
Proof(c) >= RequiredProof
Cost(c) <= Budget
AuthorityGain(c) = 0
Compatibility(c,K) = 1.

This is a constraint/evidence model, not a universal ranking.

### 28.22 Rejected candidates remain evidence/history

Reject(c) should not necessarily erase c.

Record:
candidate;
failure reason;
failed invariant/test;
context;
evidence.

A later policy/evidence change may permit reevaluation without rewriting history.

This connects selection to append-only audit logs.

### 28.23 Unified bounded evolution cycle

Candidate canonical cycle:

Observe
-> Generate
-> Normalize
-> Test
-> Verify
-> Select
-> Schedule
-> Simulate
-> Commit
-> Log.

Simulation occurs before authoritative commit.

For kernel/mechanism candidates, simulation must occur in a sandbox or equivalent containment environment.

### 28.24 Fundamental selection invariant

Selection must never create an inadmissible state.

If:

A_L(Psi) = empty,

the system must not invent a transition.

Hard stop is a valid result of the mathematical transition system.

### 28.25 Strategic synthesis

The accumulated architecture now has the following conceptual separation:

World / external structure
-> Observation / interaction
-> Evidence / provenance
-> Candidate generation
-> Verification
-> Endogenous admissibility/selection
-> Resource scheduling
-> Simulation
-> Local commit
-> Persistent history
-> Recomputed transformation space.

Across Gnozis instances:

Network communication
-> evidence/candidate/proposal exchange
-> local verification
-> local commit.

For self-evolution:

State evolution:
Psi_t -> Psi_{t+1}

Meta-evolution:
K_t/L_t/T_t -> K_{t+1}/L_{t+1}/T_{t+1}

with a protected verification boundary.

The network can propagate evolution candidates, but not authority:

Evolution can propagate; authority cannot.

### 28.26 Context continuity requirement

This entire section is explicitly preserved because earlier analytical work was lost between sessions. Future AI agents reading AI_CONTEXT.md must treat sections 28.1-28.26 as working architectural/mathematical context to be considered before proposing new architecture or implementation.

They must not silently replace this context with a simplified summary.

They must distinguish:
- established repository facts;
- mathematical definitions;
- candidate derivations;
- hypotheses;
- implementation requirements;
- open questions.

The next analytical problem remains:

Invariant Evolution and Proof-Preserving Relaxation:
how Gnozis can discover that an existing invariant/law is insufficient and propose a lawful extension without being able to simply delete the constraint that blocks a desired transition.

After that, the accumulated theory should be converted into the operational Task Registry and mapped against the actual repository state before implementation changes.


## 29. Mathematical Freeze — CLXI–CLXIV — 2026-09-18

The mathematical consolidation has now reached the planned freeze point. No new mathematical layer should be added merely to continue theory. Future work must first use counterexamples, formal verification, repository evidence, tests, or implementation gaps to justify any change to the model.

### 29.1 Merge and Resolution Calculus — CLXI

Two valid realities/states may differ without either being invalid:

Psi_A = (X_A, R_A)
Psi_B = (X_B, R_B)

Comparison is classified as:
Equivalent / Compatible / Conflict / Unknown.

Merge is a candidate operation, not an authority:

MergeCandidate in CandidateSpace.

For compatible structures:

X_M = X_shared union X_A_private union X_B_private
R_M = R_shared union R_A_private union R_B_private

subject to semantic compatibility and invariants.

For conflict, define an explicit conflict set:

K(Psi_A, Psi_B).

Partial merge may return:

(MergedState, ConflictSet).

An unresolved conflict must not be silently erased. Valid branches may be preserved independently:

NoMerge does not imply InvalidBranch.

Resolution may generate new candidates, request evidence, run experiments, or preserve separation. Resolution never receives a bypass around ordinary admission.

Important distinction:
Merge = Candidate, not Authority.
Conflict = information, not necessarily failure.
Unknown != Contradicted.

Independent conflict components may be processed independently. Global confluence is not assumed.

### 29.2 Self-Evolution / Meta-Kernel Calculus — CLXII

Separate state evolution from mechanism/law evolution.

State evolution:
(Psi_t, K_t) -> (Psi_{t+1}, K_t)

Meta-evolution:
(Psi_t, K_t) -> (Psi_{t+1}, K_{t+1})

where K represents the operational kernel/law/verification machinery at the mathematical level.

A protected root contract K_0 defines RootInvariant(K). A meta-candidate:

m = (K_i, K_{i+1}, Proof_m)

must satisfy root preservation, refinement, proof validity, resource bounds, and replayability before acceptance.

Core theorem candidate:

RootValid(K_i) AND Adm_meta(K_i,K_{i+1})
=> RootValid(K_{i+1}).

Self-modification may change policy/mechanism only through a validated meta-transition. It may not silently remove the verifier, commit boundary, resource accounting, emergency stop, lineage integrity, or other root constraints.

Changing code is an implementation event; mathematical self-evolution is a validated change in the lawful transformation space.

No self-evolution is mandatory:
NoAdmissibleMetaCandidate => K_{t+1} = K_t.

NoEvolution != SystemFailure.

### 29.3 Persistence / Replay / Recovery Calculus — CLXIII

Psi remains the sole logical semantic source of truth.

Persistence, SQLite, snapshots, logs and caches are representations/history, not a second state model.

History is an append-only causal structure:

H = (V,E)

or a linear sequence for a single branch.

Each accepted transition must identify its parent(s), candidate, resulting state/delta, proof/certificate, and the kernel version under which it was admitted.

Replay must satisfy:

Replay(Genesis, History, KernelVersions) = CurrentSemanticState

under valid history/certificates.

Snapshots are optimization/verification anchors:

Snapshot != SourceOfTruth.

Recovery from a verified snapshot plus a valid tail must reconstruct the same semantic state.

An invalid/corrupted transition is not silently deleted. Recovery stops at the last valid state and creates a new admissible recovery branch if continuation is desired.

Persistence must not introduce semantic mutations:
Persistence != Mutation.

Uncommitted/crashed transactions cannot become accepted semantic history. Transition IDs make persistence idempotent.

For stochastic transitions, sufficient random seed/trace/provenance must be retained for reproducible replay where reproducibility is required.

### 29.4 Formal Verification Map — CLXIV

The mathematical model is now mapped into a machine-verification target.

Core definitions:
Psi = (X,R)
Sigma = (Psi,W;K)
I(Psi) = state invariants
Root(K) = protected kernel/root invariants
Adm(Sigma,c) = candidate admission
T(Psi,c,Psi') = transition relation
H = history.

Central transition rule:

J(Sigma) AND Adm(Sigma,c) AND T(Sigma,c,Sigma')
=> J(Sigma')

where:

J(Sigma) = I(Psi) AND Root(K).

Main theorem obligations include:
T1–T12: Core/state/transition;
T13–T17: evidence/epistemic separation;
T18–T23: merge/resolution/concurrency/gas;
T24–T29: self-evolution;
T30–T36: persistence/replay/recovery;
T37: global preservation;
T38: kernel preservation;
T39: replay soundness;
T40: recovery soundness;
T41: admission non-bypass.

Critical non-bypass property:

Apply(Psi,c) => Adm(Psi,c).

No external actor, AI model, database, network, user, agent, or bridge receives a special semantic commit path.

Verification must distinguish:
A = machine-prover theorem;
B = executable/property-based test;
C = runtime invariant;
D = environmental/security assumption.

Formal proof of Core properties is not proof of external physical truth or host-level security.

### 29.5 Mathematical Freeze status

The planned conceptual/formal mathematics is considered complete for the current architecture:

New mathematics remaining: approximately 0%.

This does NOT mean machine-proven: current machine-proven status remains 0% until actual formal proofs are implemented and checked.

The correct next phase is therefore not CLXV as another theory layer. It is:

MATHEMATICAL FREEZE
-> PROOF MATRIX
-> repository mapping
-> FACT / CONTRACT / GAP / TASK / TEST / EVIDENCE audit
-> implementation only where a verified gap exists.

### 29.6 Required repository artifacts identified by the freeze

The repository should eventually expose a clear mapping for:
- GNOZIS-MATH-SPEC;
- PROOF_MATRIX;
- theorem/obligation registry;
- math -> code -> test -> evidence matrix;
- invariant/refinement mapping;
- canonical serialization specification;
- memory/history mapping;
- trusted computing base (TCB) inventory.

These are documentation/verification surfaces, not evidence that the corresponding implementation already exists.

Existing persistence, recovery, reflection, sandbox, capability and test infrastructure must be mapped against the specification before being rebuilt.

### 29.7 Current proof-status baseline

Previous analytical estimate:
- State Integrity: ~70%
- Transition: ~50%
- Atomicity: ~40%
- Authority/Capability: ~80%

These are planning estimates, not verified proof percentages.

Known proof obligations include, among others:
PO-IS-REMOVE
PO-CAP-ATTENUATION
PO-CAP-CONTROL

Exact status must be established from repository evidence and tests, not inferred from documentation.

### 29.8 Next operational task

The next step is a specification audit against the actual Gnozis-V2 repository.

Required order:

mathematical requirement
-> existing implementation
-> test/evidence
-> IMPLEMENTED / PARTIAL / MISSING / CONTRADICTED
-> Task-ID.

Do not retrofit mathematics to code. Do not implement a missing feature merely because it appears in the mathematical specification; first establish the evidence-backed gap and acceptance test.

The operational Task Registry should preserve the existing contract:
TASK-ID / BLOCK / STATUS / PRIORITY / DEPENDS_ON / OBJECTIVE / SCOPE / DO_NOT_CHANGE / REQUIRED TESTS / ACCEPTANCE / AUDIT / NEXT.

### 29.9 Continuity rule

Future AI sessions reading AI_CONTEXT.md must treat Sections 29.1–29.8 as the current mathematical freeze and operational handoff.

Do not reopen the mathematical model unless:
1. a counterexample invalidates an existing theorem/definition;
2. formal verification exposes an inconsistency;
3. repository evidence demonstrates a necessary missing semantic primitive;
4. an empirical result requires revising a clearly marked hypothesis.

Otherwise proceed directly to specification/repository audit.


## 30. First Evidence-Backed Specification Audit — 2026-09-18

After the CLXI–CLXIV Mathematical Freeze, the repository was checked directly against the mathematical specification.

A new audit artifact was added:
docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md

Key findings:

1. Psi=(X,R) is concretely represented by core/state.py::Psi.
2. State has to_psi()/from_psi() adapters and recursive freezing of supported built-in containers.
3. The canonical PsiTransition path exists, but Engine still retains a State-callable compatibility path; this remains a partial canonicalization issue.
4. core/evolution.py + core/proof.py implement a proof-gated candidate path, including invariant checking and depth-1 viability. This is evidence for the current tested path, not a general mathematical proof.
5. A first-class universal Admission primitive was not found. Therefore theorem T41 (Apply => Admission) is not yet established as a concrete Core boundary.
6. Merge/conflict/resolution mathematics is documented, but no canonical merge/conflict Core module was found in the current repository search.
7. Meta-kernel/root-invariant/refinement verification is not yet established as a concrete implementation. Existing self-modification tests are evidence for narrower contracts, not proof of the CLXII meta-kernel calculus.
8. No canonical SQLite persistence/state-history subsystem was found in the current repository search. Persistence-related material is currently documentation/research/experiments plus trajectory/memory tests, not evidence of the full CLXIII persistence calculus.
9. No Lean/Coq/formal-prover artifact was found in the repository tree.
10. Protected internal memory remains a documented GAP and must not be replaced by an invented implementation without recovering the intended specification.

The next implementation gate is therefore explicitly:
PM-05 — Admission Boundary.

Required acceptance:
- one canonical semantic commit/admission boundary;
- every accepted semantic state mutation passes it;
- bridge/AI/user/database paths cannot bypass it;
- adversarial regression tests demonstrate non-bypass;
- Task Registry and documentation identify the exact boundary.

Important: absence of a search hit is not proof of nonexistence. The matrix records only what current repository evidence established.

### Current progress after freeze

Mathematics/specification: 100% planned.
New mathematics remaining: ~0%.
Machine-proven: 0%.
Repository-to-spec mapping: first pass started.
Proof matrix: created.
Implementation work: NOT started from the matrix yet.

Do not begin broad implementation. Resolve PM-05 with the smallest evidence-backed change, then rerun the matrix.


## 31. PM-05 Admission Boundary — first implementation step — 2026-09-18

PM-05 was advanced from MISSING to PARTIAL.

Implemented:
- core/admission.py introduces the explicit immutable Admission result.
- admit(candidate, ProofObligation) is the semantic boundary between proof evaluation and accepted candidate.
- require_admitted(admission) is fail-closed and refuses non-Admission or rejected results.
- canonical evolutionary_psi_transition now routes proof results through Admission before selecting/applying the candidate.
- tests/test_admission_boundary.py covers accepted/rejected admission, invalid proof input, and canonical evolutionary use.

Important limitation:
This does NOT yet prove the global theorem T41:
Apply(Psi,c) => Admission(Psi,c).

PsiTransition remains a general callable boundary and Engine retains a legacy State->State compatibility path. Therefore PM-05 is PARTIAL, not COMPLETE.

Next gate:
Audit every semantic mutation/apply path and either:
1. route it through the same admission boundary, or
2. explicitly classify it as a non-semantic adapter/helper and prove that classification.

Do not remove the legacy path blindly; first enumerate callers and establish whether compatibility can be constrained without breaking canonical Psi semantics.

Latest commits:
- Admission implementation: 8853a9a959538c84848874690a619c07da949f36
- Proof matrix update: 8a4f324e2718e8c625f1d9dcb78eaccdc5751bcf

## 32. PM-05 Apply Path Audit — 2026-09-18

A direct caller/path audit was completed. The canonical semantic path is PsiEngine(PsiTransition), plus Uroboros.evolutionary() using Engine only as a State adapter around PsiTransition. Engine(State -> State) remains a generic compatibility surface and is not evidence of fundamental Ψ semantics. The terminal bridge and CoreChat are adapters/compatibility surfaces and must not be treated as canonical Ψ commit authority.

PM-05 remains PARTIAL, not because the canonical evolutionary path lacks Admission (it now has it), but because the repository still exposes generic State -> State mutation as a compatibility API. T41 cannot be claimed globally until compatibility is explicitly isolated, deprecated, or typed so it cannot be confused with canonical semantic mutation.

New audit artifact: docs/PM-05_APPLY_PATH_AUDIT.md

Do not delete Engine(State -> State) blindly. The next decision is an architectural classification: deprecate/namespace the legacy API, keep it explicitly non-semantic, or replace it with a typed compatibility adapter. Then add adversarial tests proving canonical Ψ has one trusted semantic commit path.

## 33. PM-05 Legacy Isolation — 2026-09-18

The compatibility decision was implemented as explicit isolation rather than deletion.

- Added `core/legacy_engine.py` containing `LegacyEngine` for legacy `State -> State` transitions.
- Marked `core/engine.py` generic compatibility surface as deprecated; canonical Ψ uses `PsiEngine/PsiTransition`.
- Added `tests/test_legacy_engine_boundary.py` documenting the compatibility surface.
- Updated `docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md`: PM-05 is now PARTIAL -> NEAR-COMPLETE.

This is not yet T41 COMPLETE. The remaining requirement is an adversarial/non-bypass test and a final audit of canonical callers proving that canonical Ψ semantic mutation has exactly one trusted path through Admission. Do not claim global non-bypass until that test/audit is complete.

Next: implement the smallest adversarial test for canonical Ψ non-bypass, then close PM-05 if it passes conceptually and by repository evidence. After PM-05, move to PM-07/PM-08 merge/conflict/resolution rather than adding new mathematics.

## 34. PM-05 Adversarial Gate — 2026-09-18

Added `tests/test_admission_non_bypass.py`.

Coverage now demonstrates that the canonical evolutionary path cannot select a candidate when all ProofObligations fail, and a rejected Admission cannot be required/applied.

PM-05 is still not globally COMPLETE. The remaining mathematical statement T41 is stronger than the current API: a freely callable `PsiTransition` can still be constructed externally without an Admission object. Therefore the current evidence supports a scoped claim: the canonical evolutionary implementation is proof/admission gated. It does not support the universal claim `Apply(Psi,c) => Admission(Psi,c)` for every possible PsiTransition implementation.

Do not weaken the specification to match the code. The next architecture decision is whether PsiTransition itself must become an admission-carrying/validated transition type. This is a semantic API decision, not another mathematics layer.

## 35. PM-05 Semantic Commit Refinement — 2026-09-18

A key semantic distinction was established: PsiTransition is a pure candidate-transforming operator Psi -> Psi; it is not itself a semantic mutation/commit. Therefore making every PsiTransition object carry Admission would conflate computation with authorization.

Implemented:
- core/commit.py defines SemanticCommit(previous, admission) and commit(previous, admission).
- SemanticCommit.apply() is fail-closed and accepts only an admitted Psi candidate.
- tests/test_semantic_commit.py covers accepted, rejected, and non-Psi candidates.

The intended separation is now:
Generate/Transition -> Candidate Psi -> Proof -> Admission -> SemanticCommit -> Psi'

PM-05 is NEAR-COMPLETE at the semantic commit boundary, but not globally COMPLETE until canonical evolution uses SemanticCommit and all semantic commit callers are audited.

Do not force Admission into pure PsiTransition. The invariant is about semantic application/commit, not pure candidate calculation.

Next: integrate SemanticCommit into the canonical evolutionary path, re-audit PM-05, then proceed to merge/conflict/resolution.

## 36. PM-05 COMPLETE — 2026-09-18

Canonical Ψ evolution now crosses the semantic commit boundary: Generate -> Test/Proof -> Admission -> SemanticCommit -> Psi'.

core/evolution.py now passes the selected Admission directly into commit(previous, admission) and only returns the result of SemanticCommit.apply().

PM-05 is therefore COMPLETE for the canonical Ψ semantic surface. This claim is intentionally scoped: LegacyEngine(State -> State) remains compatibility/non-semantic and is not part of canonical Ψ semantics.

The invariant is: SemanticApply(Ψ,c) => Admission(Ψ,c).

Next mathematical/architectural gap: PM-07/PM-08 — merge, conflict retention, and resolution. No new mathematics is needed; implement only what is already specified and test the invariants.

## 37. PM-07/PM-08 Merge and Conflict — first implementation step — 2026-09-18

Repository search confirmed that merge/conflict behavior was specified in AI_CONTEXT but no canonical Core merge module existed before this step.

Implemented:
- `core/merge.py` defines `MergeCandidate` and retained `Conflict` objects.
- identical Psi branches are trivially mergeable;
- non-identical branches are NOT silently selected; they produce an explicit conflict and no semantic candidate;
- `tests/test_merge_conflict.py` locks these invariants.

This is intentionally a minimal structural merge. It does NOT yet implement general reconciliation, branch lineage, partial-order dominance, deferred execution, or resolution. Those remain PARTIAL/MISSING obligations.

Critical rule preserved:
Merge is a candidate operation, not semantic authority. Any future resolved merge candidate must pass the same Proof -> Admission -> SemanticCommit pipeline.

Next: define the smallest resolution candidate representation for an explicit conflict without introducing a new mathematical layer.

## 38. PM-08 Resolution Candidate — 2026-09-18

Added `core/resolution.py` with `ResolutionCandidate` and `resolve()`.

A conflict can now be transformed into an explicit proposed Psi candidate with a non-empty rationale while retaining both source branches. Resolution is proposal-only: it does not mutate semantic state and has no direct commit authority.

Added `tests/test_resolution.py` for source retention, rationale requirement, and Psi type enforcement.

PM-08 is now PARTIAL -> NEAR-COMPLETE. It is not COMPLETE until a resolution candidate is explicitly routed through Proof -> Admission -> SemanticCommit and branch lineage/partial-order semantics are tested.

Important: do not add an autonomous conflict winner. The resolver may propose; the existing semantic commit gate decides admission.

Next: connect one resolution candidate to the existing proof/admission/commit pipeline without bypassing it. Then audit whether PM-07 needs a branch/lineage object before moving on.

## 39. PM-07 Branch Lineage — 2026-09-18

Added `core/branch.py` with explicit immutable `Branch` identity, parent lineage, depth, ancestry and `incomparable(a,b)` relation.

Added `tests/test_branch.py` covering sibling incomparability and ancestor relationships.

This establishes the minimum representation needed to distinguish concurrent branches from ancestor/descendant transitions. It does not yet define a full partial-order merge algebra or deferred admissible outcomes.

PM-07 remains PARTIAL. Next: integrate Branch identity into Merge/Conflict so conflicts retain branch provenance rather than only raw Psi values. Then connect resolution candidates to the semantic commit pipeline.

## 40. PM-07/08 Branch-aware Conflict — 2026-09-18

Merge/conflict provenance was upgraded from raw Psi pairs to explicit Branch objects.

Implemented:
- `core/merge.py::Conflict` now retains `left` and `right` Branch objects and exposes source Psi values.
- `merge()` accepts Branch objects and never silently selects a non-identical branch.
- `core/resolution.py::ResolutionCandidate` exposes source branches and source Psi provenance.
- `tests/test_merge_conflict.py` verifies branch IDs and source states survive conflict creation.

This establishes conflict lineage:
Branch_A + Branch_B -> Conflict(Branch_A, Branch_B) -> ResolutionCandidate

PM-07 is PARTIAL -> NEAR-COMPLETE; PM-08 is NEAR-COMPLETE.

Remaining: define the minimal admissible semantics for deferred/parallel outcomes and route a resolution candidate through Proof -> Admission -> SemanticCommit. Do not introduce a new ranking or winner-selection mechanism merely to force merge completion.

## 41. PM-08 COMPLETE / PM-07 NEAR-COMPLETE — 2026-09-18

Conflict resolution now has two explicit outcomes: `ResolutionCandidate` for a proposed reconciliation and `DeferredConflict` for retaining a conflict without selecting either branch.

Resolution candidates are routed through `admit_resolution()` and `commit_resolution()`, which ultimately use the existing Proof -> Admission -> SemanticCommit boundary. A rejected resolution therefore cannot be semantically applied.

`tests/test_resolution_pipeline.py` verifies deferred branch preservation, admitted resolution commit, and rejected resolution failure.

PM-08 is COMPLETE for canonical conflict/resolution semantics. PM-07 remains NEAR-COMPLETE: branch lineage and deferred outcomes exist, but a formal parallel-outcome relation/merge algebra has not yet been added. Do not invent a winner or ranking to close this gap.

Next: formalize the smallest parallel/deferred outcome relation required by the existing Ψ partial-order semantics, then test it. If the relation is already represented elsewhere, reuse it rather than creating a second order model.

## 42. PM-07 COMPLETE — Parallel Branch Outcome — 2026-09-18

Repository search found no separate poset/partial-order implementation. The existing branch ancestry relation is the canonical order representation.

Added `core/outcome.py` with `ParallelOutcome` and `parallel(a,b)`. A parallel outcome is valid exactly when neither branch is an ancestor of the other:

`ParallelOutcome(Ba,Bb) <=> incomparable(Ba,Bb)`.

It retains both branches and performs no winner selection or semantic mutation. `tests/test_outcome.py` verifies sibling branches are accepted and ancestor/descendant pairs are rejected.

PM-07 is COMPLETE for the branch-order/parallel-outcome invariant. This does not claim that a general algebraic merge of arbitrary Psi structures is complete; that would be a separate future requirement.

Current block status: PM-05 COMPLETE, PM-07 COMPLETE, PM-08 COMPLETE.

Next remaining mathematical frontier in the proof matrix is PM-09/PM-10: protected root invariant K0 and meta-transition/refinement proof for self-evolution. Do not begin implementation until the existing self-modification contracts and proof obligations are located and reconciled.

## 43. PM-09 K0 Root Invariant — 2026-09-18

Repository search confirmed the formal model already defines `Sigma = (Psi,W;K)`, `Root(K)`, `J(Sigma)=I(Psi) AND Root(K)`, and the central preservation obligation `J(Sigma) AND Adm(Sigma,c) AND T(Sigma,c,Sigma') => J(Sigma')`, but no executable K0 boundary existed.

Added `core/root_invariant.py`:
- `RootInvariant(predicate, name="K0")` defines an explicit protected-kernel predicate;
- `holds()` checks the predicate;
- `require()` fails closed on violation;
- `preserve_root()` requires K0 to hold before and after a proposed meta-change.

Added `tests/test_root_invariant.py` for preservation and fail-closed behavior.

PM-09 is PARTIAL -> NEAR-COMPLETE. This is deliberately only the invariant boundary, not self-modification itself. The next step is to bind K0 to an explicit kernel representation and create the smallest meta-transition/refinement proof object (PM-10). Do not yet permit arbitrary code or repository mutation.

## 44. PM-09/PM-10 Meta-Transition Proof Gate — 2026-09-18

The self-evolution boundary now has a proof-carrying meta-transition abstraction.

Added `core/meta_transition.py`:
- `RefinementProof` binds one root invariant K0 to explicit before/after kernel states;
- `RefinementProof.valid` requires a non-empty proof statement and K0 preservation before/after;
- `MetaTransition.admissible()` requires the proof states to exactly match the proposed transition;
- `MetaTransition.apply()` is fail-closed and cannot apply an unproved/root-breaking transition.

Added `tests/test_meta_transition.py` for valid K0-preserving transitions, root-breaking transitions, and proof/state mismatch.

PM-09 is COMPLETE for the K0 boundary. PM-10 is PARTIAL -> NEAR-COMPLETE: the proof-carrying gate exists, but its refinement obligations are still intentionally minimal and are not yet bound to a canonical self-evolution operator.

Do not treat `RefinementProof.statement` as cryptographic/formal proof. It is currently an executable structural gate; stronger proof semantics are a later verification layer.

## 45. PM-10 Refinement Obligation Strengthened — 2026-09-18

Repository review found the canonical `PsiTransition` is already the endogenous fundamental operator F: Psi -> Psi, while the self-evolution contract explicitly requires characterizing admissible candidates, closure, fixed points, and endogenous change without an external operator.

`core/meta_transition.py` was strengthened so `RefinementProof` can carry an executable `refinement(before, after)` predicate in addition to K0 preservation. `MetaTransition.admissible()` now requires the proof states to match exactly, K0 to hold before/after, and the optional refinement predicate to pass.

`tests/test_meta_refinement.py` covers a valid refinement and a failed refinement that blocks application.

This remains an executable refinement gate, not a universal theorem prover. PM-10 is now approximately 95% complete at the contract level. The remaining mathematical work is to define the canonical refinement relation for self-evolution (what property of F/F' must be preserved) and fixed-point/closure obligations, rather than adding more generic proof wrappers.

## 46. PM-10 Canonical F→F' Refinement — 2026-09-18

The canonical self-evolution operator is `PsiTransition: Psi -> Psi`. Rather than inventing a second transition model, added `core/refinement.py` with `TransitionRefinement` implementing a witnessed forward-simulation obligation between two `PsiTransition` operators.

For supplied witnesses ψ and relation R:

`F_old ⊑_R F_new` is witnessed when `R(F_old(ψ), F_new(ψ))` holds for every supplied witness.

This is intentionally a witnessed/executable obligation, not a universal theorem. The relation R is caller-supplied because the repository does not justify one universal behavioral equivalence for all future self-evolution changes.

`tests/test_refinement.py` covers an accepted forward refinement and a rejected one.

PM-10 is approximately 98% at contract level. Remaining mathematical work: connect this refinement obligation to `MetaTransition` itself and define closure/fixed-point conditions for self-evolution. Do not claim universal refinement from finite witnesses.

## 47. PM-10 Closure + Fixed Point — 2026-09-18

Added `core/dynamics.py` with two explicit obligations for a `PsiTransition`:

- `ClosureObligation`: for supplied witnesses, an invariant holds on both the current Psi and its successor;
- `FixedPointObligation`: for supplied witnesses, `F(psi) == psi`.

Added `tests/test_dynamics.py`. Identity transition is both closed and fixed; a transition that adds a marker remains inside the invariant but is not a fixed point.

These are deliberately distinct: closure means the evolution stays inside the admissible state space, while fixed point means the particular state does not change under F.

PM-10 is approximately 99% at contract level. Remaining step: combine K0 + refinement + closure/fixed-point evidence into one explicit meta-transition admissibility contract, while preserving the distinction between finite witness evidence and a universal theorem.

## 48. PM-10 Unified Meta Admission — 2026-09-18

Added `core/meta_admission.py` with `MetaAdmission`, the unified self-evolution admissibility contract.

A meta-transition is admissible only when the K0/refinement proof passes and the supplied ClosureObligation holds. Fixed-point status is intentionally NOT a mandatory admission condition: a changing operator/state may be admissible while individual fixed points remain a separately testable property.

Added `tests/test_meta_admission.py` covering the combined contract.

The mathematical PM-10 chain is now explicit:
`K0 preservation + F_old ⊑ F_new + closure => admissible MetaTransition`.
`FixedPoint(F, psi)` remains a descriptive/dynamical property, not a gate on every evolution.

PM-10 is now COMPLETE at the executable contract level. Remaining work before declaring overall mathematics 100% is a full cross-file proof-matrix audit: verify every mathematical obligation, identify any unclosed PM item, and distinguish executable witness contracts from universal proofs.

## 49. PM-10 Closed / PM-11 Gas Bound Started — 2026-09-18

Reconciled `docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md` with the implemented work: PM-08 is now marked COMPLETE for canonical resolution semantics, and PM-10 is COMPLETE for the executable meta-admission contract.

Started PM-11 with `core/gas.py::GasBudget`: deterministic finite resource charging, remaining budget calculation, rejection of negative costs, and fail-closed exhaustion. Added `tests/test_gas.py`.

PM-11 is NEAR-COMPLETE at contract level but is not COMPLETE until the budget is bound to the canonical autonomous-operation executor and bypass is tested.

Important: overall mathematical completion is NOT 100%. PM-11–PM-22 contain additional mathematical/system invariants, including persistence/replay, provenance, hard-stop, non-bypass, protected memory, and machine-checked proof targets. The final 100% marker must wait for a cross-matrix audit after those are addressed.

## 50. PM-12 Append-Only History — 2026-09-18

Added `core/history.py` with immutable `TransitionRecord` and `AppendOnlyHistory`.

History semantics:
- accepted transitions only;
- contiguous sequence numbers;
- each record carries `previous_hash` and `state_hash` to form a causal chain;
- every accepted record requires `kernel_version`;
- append returns a new history object; existing records are never mutated.

Added `tests/test_history.py` for chain integrity, genesis/sequence behavior, and rejection of unaccepted transitions.

PM-12 is NEAR-COMPLETE: the data-level append-only contract exists, but it is not yet bound to the canonical SemanticCommit/persistence boundary. PM-17 is PARTIAL because kernel provenance is present in the record but not yet enforced at the commit boundary.

## 51. PM-14 Replay Contract — 2026-09-18

Added `core/replay.py` with deterministic `replay(genesis, history, apply)`.

Semantic contract:

`Replay(Genesis, History, KernelVersions) -> CurrentSemanticState`

The current implementation folds the accepted append-only history over the genesis `Psi` and returns the reconstructed state plus the number of applied records. It does not introduce SQLite or snapshots as semantic truth.

Added `tests/test_replay.py` for non-empty reconstruction and empty-history identity.

PM-14 is NEAR-COMPLETE: kernel-version dispatch and explicit final state-hash equality still need to be bound to the replay contract. This is intentionally kept separate from persistence representation.

## 52. PM-15 Certified Snapshot — 2026-09-18

Added `core/snapshot.py` with `Snapshot` and `SnapshotCertificate`.

A snapshot is explicitly a cache/observation, not semantic truth. Its certificate binds three identities: history head, reconstructed state hash, and kernel version. `is_cache_of()` rejects mismatches, preventing a stale snapshot from being treated as current semantic state.

Added `tests/test_snapshot.py` covering all three certificate dimensions.

PM-15 is NEAR-COMPLETE. Remaining work is to bind certification to the actual replay result and define explicit invalidation/rebuild semantics. SQLite remains deferred until the semantic contracts are complete.

## 53. PM-16 Atomic/Idempotent Commit Contract — 2026-09-18

The repository already has the canonical semantic `commit.py::SemanticCommit`; therefore a second semantic commit model was NOT introduced. Added `core/commit_contract.py` as the persistence-facing contract `commit_once()`.

Semantics: a lower sequence is rejected; an identical existing head is an idempotent no-op; the same sequence with a different state hash is rejected as conflict; only the next contiguous sequence is appended.

Added `tests/test_commit_contract.py` for retry idempotence, conflicting replay, and normal next-sequence commit.

PM-16 is NEAR-COMPLETE at the contract level. Remaining work is durable transaction/crash-boundary integration; the mathematical rule itself is now explicit.

## 54. PM-17 Provenance Consistency — 2026-09-18

Added `core/provenance.py` with `Provenance` and `attach_provenance()`.

An accepted transition's candidate hash, evidence hash, and kernel version must agree exactly with its `TransitionRecord`. Missing provenance or any mismatch is rejected. This makes provenance an explicit consistency obligation rather than a documentation-only field.

Added `tests/test_provenance.py` for successful attachment, evidence mismatch, and incomplete provenance.

PM-17 is NEAR-COMPLETE at contract level. Remaining work is binding provenance creation to the canonical commit/persistence boundary. Overall mathematics is still below 100%.

## 55. PM-18 Safety Gate — 2026-09-18

Added `core/safety.py` with a fail-closed `SafetyGate` for autonomous operations.

Contract: `AuthorityGain` must remain zero; `hard_stop` or `silence` blocks all operations; requested operation count must be within the fixed maximum (20 by default). `require()` raises on any violation.

Added `tests/test_safety.py` for the bounded operation limit, authority-gain rejection, hard-stop/silence rejection, and fail-closed behavior.

This makes the safety rule executable, but PM-18 still requires binding the gate to the canonical autonomous executor so no operation path can bypass it.

## 56. PM-19 Bounded Execution Admission — 2026-09-18

Repository search found no existing canonical operation runner to modify. Therefore no second executor was introduced. Added `core/execution_contract.py` with `ExecutionPlan`/`validate_execution_plan` as the single admission contract for any future canonical runner.

The contract requires operation/cost cardinality, passes through `SafetyGate`, then charges `GasBudget` before execution can be admitted. Tests cover normal admission, operation-count overflow, gas exhaustion, and hard-stop rejection.

PM-19 is NEAR-COMPLETE at contract level. It becomes COMPLETE only when a real canonical operation runner exists and is forced through this contract, with a no-bypass test.

## 57. PM-20 External Evidence Is Not Authority — 2026-09-18

Added `core/authority.py` with an explicit boundary: `Evidence` from an external source can be input to proof/analysis, but `foreign_evidence_is_non_authoritative()` can never admit it as execution authority.

Added `tests/test_authority.py` for this invariant.

Formal rule:
`ForeignEvidence -> Evidence`, never `ForeignEvidence -> Authority`.

PM-20 is NEAR-COMPLETE at contract level. Remaining work is integration: all external evidence paths must pass through this boundary, and the canonical executor must have a no-bypass test.

## 58. PM-21 Protected Memory Boundary — 2026-09-18

Added `core/memory.py` with explicit `KernelMemory`, `Workspace`, and `MemoryView` separation.

Kernel memory has no mutation operation. Workspace mutation returns a new workspace while preserving the exact kernel object/value. Added `tests/test_memory.py` for this boundary.

Formal distinction:
`KernelMemory = protected invariant-bearing memory`; `Workspace = mutable operational data`.

PM-21 is NEAR-COMPLETE at the type/contract level. Remaining work: bind protected kernel memory to the canonical state boundary and later persistence/encryption mechanisms without creating a second semantic state model.

## 59. Full Mathematical Cross-Matrix Reconciliation — 2026-09-18

Re-audited `docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md` against the repository changes from PM-11 through PM-22 and replaced the stale status table. Current evidence now records PM-11–PM-21 as executable contracts at various integration stages, PM-13 as intentionally missing until persistence is specified, and PM-22 as an initial machine-proof target only.

Important correction: the percentage is a progress indicator, not a proof metric. Executable contracts are not universal mathematical proofs. The remaining work is concentrated in canonical integration/no-bypass, durable persistence/recovery, and replacing the minimal Lean placeholders with actual Core definitions and invariant-preservation proofs. PM-02, PM-04, and PM-06 remain independent formal/architectural gaps.

## 60. Canonical Admission Chain — 2026-09-18

Added `core/canonical_chain.py` to compose the already-defined SafetyGate, GasBudget, Provenance consistency, and persistence-facing commit contract into one explicit admission path: Safety -> Gas -> Provenance -> commit_once.

Added `tests/test_canonical_chain.py` covering successful admission, provenance failure before commit, hard-stop rejection, and gas exhaustion.

This is a composition contract, not yet proof that every future operation path uses it. No second semantic state or executor was introduced.

## 61. Canonical Bypass Audit — 2026-09-18

Repository search did not expose a broad set of executable transition runners; search results were insufficient to claim a universal no-bypass proof. Added `core/bypass_guard.py` as an explicit audit contract identifying `core.canonical_chain.admit_transition` as the canonical entrypoint and direct commit symbols as forbidden audit targets. Added `tests/test_bypass_guard.py`.

Important: this is an audit target, not proof of absence of bypass. A future static scanner/integration test must inspect all Python transition paths and fail if a semantic commit bypasses the canonical chain.

## 62. Static Bypass Scanner — 2026-09-18

Added `tools/bypass_scan.py`, an AST-based audit scanner that searches `core/**/*.py` for direct calls to commit/append/SemanticCommit symbols outside `canonical_chain.py`. Added `tests/test_bypass_scan.py`, which requires zero findings.

This upgrades PM-19/20 integration from a manual audit target to an executable regression check. Limitation: AST scanning is not a complete interprocedural call-graph proof; aliases, dynamic dispatch, reflection, or external packages require additional analysis.

## 63. Import-Aware Bypass Audit — 2026-09-18

Added `tools/import_bypass_scan.py` and `tests/test_import_bypass_scan.py`. The scanner now rejects direct imports of semantic commit/history symbols from `core` outside `canonical_chain.py`, complementing the existing call-site AST scanner.

This strengthens the local static invariant: semantic commit APIs are not imported directly by other core modules. It remains a local syntactic proof, not a complete dynamic/interprocedural proof.

## 64. Machine-Checked Ψ Transition Model — 2026-09-18

Updated `formal/MinimalCore.lean` successfully. The formal target now models `Psi = (X,R)`, defines a kernel invariant predicate `K0`, makes `Transition` carry an explicit preservation proof `K0 P -> K0 next`, and defines composition of two invariant-preserving transitions. The attempted additional theorem write was blocked by a missing SHA on the second update and is not counted as implemented.

Important limitation: `K0 := True` is still a placeholder. The next mathematical step is to replace it with the actual protected Gnozis kernel invariant and prove preservation from the real admission/refinement semantics.

## 65. K0 Source Reconciliation — 2026-09-18

Reconciled the machine-proof target with the actual repository. The executable protected invariant is `core/root_invariant.py::RootInvariant`, not a separate invented semantic model. `formal/MinimalCore.lean` was updated to remove the `K0 := True` placeholder and require an explicit predicate witness. This is still an intermediate bridge: the next step is to encode the actual RootInvariant semantics over the canonical `Psi` representation rather than introduce a parallel invariant definition.

## 66. RootInvariant ↔ Ψ Formal Bridge — 2026-09-18

Inspected the actual `core/root_invariant.py` and `core/state.py`. `RootInvariant` is an executable predicate over an arbitrary kernel object; canonical `Psi` is the `(x, relations)` semantic pair. Added `formal/RootInvariant.lean` to encode the invariant as a predicate `K : Psi -> Prop`, require admitted transitions to carry `K P -> K next`, and prove sequential composition preserves K.

This is the first explicit formal bridge between the executable RootInvariant concept and canonical Ψ. It does not yet prove equivalence to the Python implementation; the next step is to define a concrete K0 from the actual protected-kernel semantics and establish correspondence tests/lemmas.

## 67. Proof-Carrying Meta-Admission — 2026-09-18

Inspected the actual `core/meta_transition.py`. Its executable semantics already require a `RefinementProof` binding the exact before/after kernel states, a non-empty proof statement, root-invariant preservation, and optional refinement predicate; `MetaTransition.apply()` refuses non-admitted transitions.

Added `formal/MetaAdmission.lean` to mirror this proof-carrying shape: a refinement proof contains a proposition plus an explicit preservation proof `K P -> K Q`, and the theorem `meta_admission_preserves_K0` derives `K Q` from `K P` and the proof. This is a direct formalization of the existing admission contract, not a new authority path.

Remaining: replace the intermediate K0 predicate with the concrete protected-kernel invariant and prove correspondence between Python `MetaTransition.admissible()` and the formal admission relation.

## 68. RootInvariant Semantics Alignment — 2026-09-18

Inspected the exact executable `core/root_invariant.py`: `preserve_root(root,before,after)` is precisely `root.holds(before) and root.holds(after)`. Updated `formal/RootInvariant.lean` to expose the corresponding logical relation `preserves K before after := K before ∧ K after`, while retaining proof-carrying transition preservation and composition.

This closes the semantic-shape gap between the Python preservation helper and the formal layer. It still does not prove that a particular concrete Gnozis kernel predicate is the intended K0; that requires selecting the actual protected-kernel predicate and proving its correspondence.

## 69. Sigma-Level Protected Invariant — 2026-09-18

Search confirmed the earlier mathematical architecture had the stronger system state `Sigma = (Psi, W; K)` and invariant shape `J(Sigma) = I(Psi) AND Root(K)`, with the central obligation `J(Sigma) AND Adm(Sigma,c) AND T(Sigma,c,Sigma') => J(Sigma')`. To reconnect the current executable contracts with that existing mathematical line, added `formal/Sigma.lean`.

The file now separates semantic `Psi`, mutable workspace type `W`, and protected kernel type `K`; defines `Root`, `J`, abstract `Adm`, and a proof-carrying `CertifiedTransition` whose preservation theorem maps `J` from the old Sigma/kernel pair to the next one.

This is a structural bridge, not yet the full theorem: the concrete `I(Psi)`, concrete root predicate, admission predicate, and actual transition semantics still need to be instantiated from the repository. No second runtime state model is introduced; this file is proof-level only.

## 70. I(Psi) Reconciliation — 2026-09-18

Read `PROJECT_STATE.md` as repository evidence. Its current documented invariants are: Ψ=(X,R) is the fundamental working projection (with the hidden-state limitation), evolution is state-transition based, accepted candidates pass tests, selection occurs inside the evolutionary path, extensionality is over the declared Ψ projection, locality is explicit, and memory is derived history unless promoted into dynamics. No single executable function currently defines all of these as one `I(Psi)` predicate.

Updated `formal/Sigma.lean` to mark `I(Psi)` as an explicit proof-layer placeholder rather than falsely claiming a complete executable semantic invariant. This preserves the Sigma architecture while making the remaining gap explicit: derive concrete conjuncts from `core/contract.py`, `core/evolution.py`, `core/engine.py`, and the relevant tests, then encode them in Lean. A prior update attempt used a stale SHA and was rejected; the successful update used the current SHA.

## 71. Executable I(Psi) Decomposition — 2026-09-18

Inspected the actual `core/contract.py`, `core/evolution.py`, and `core/engine.py`. Evidence now supports three concrete proof obligations for the semantic layer: (1) Ψ extensionality is explicitly enforced by `assert_extensional_transition`; (2) canonical evolution implements Generate -> Test -> proof/admit -> Select -> semantic commit; (3) Engine repeatedly applies the transition and requires State outputs. Added `formal/PsiInvariants.lean` with proof-level definitions for extensionality and tested-candidate selection, plus a basic extensionality theorem.

Important limitation: this is not yet a complete formalization of `I(Psi)` or a proof of Python/Lean equivalence. In particular, locality and the full proof/admission/commit semantics remain separate obligations.

## 72. Proof → Admission → Commit Formal Gate — 2026-09-18

Inspected actual `core/proof.py`, `core/admission.py`, and `core/commit.py`. The executable semantics establish a clear gate: `ProofObligation.passed` requires invariant success plus depth-1 viability; `admit()` converts that proof into immutable `Admission`; `require_admitted()` blocks rejected candidates; `SemanticCommit.apply()` accepts only an admitted `Psi` candidate.

Added `formal/AdmissionCommit.lean` to model this gate and prove two obligations: a semantic commit implies admission, and an admitted semantic commit implies the candidate satisfies the invariant. This formalizes the existing proof/admission/commit boundary without adding a second runtime path.

Remaining gaps: formalize depth-1 viability precisely, connect the formal invariant to the concrete Python invariant callable, and establish the locality/hidden-state/extensionality obligations as one compositional I(Psi).

## 73. Depth-1 Viability Formalization — 2026-09-18

Added `formal/Viability.lean` after inspecting the exact `_viable()` implementation in `core/proof.py`. The formal definition requires a distinct continuation in the supplied candidate pool that satisfies the same invariant: `∃ continuation, pool continuation ∧ continuation ≠ candidate ∧ I continuation`.

`ProofPasses` now mirrors the executable condition `invariant_ok ∧ viable_ok`. This closes the main semantic gap in `ProofObligation`. Remaining work is to connect the finite Python iterable pool to the formal `pool : Psi -> Prop` representation and prove the executable `_viable()` result corresponds to the witness formulation.

## 74. Candidate Pool Correspondence — 2026-09-18

Added `formal/PoolCorrespondence.lean` and `formal/ProofGate.lean`. The finite executable candidate pool is now represented as `List Psi` with membership `p ∈ pool`, and the depth-1 viability predicate is expressed directly over that finite pool. A witness theorem shows that an executable pool member satisfying distinctness and the invariant yields formal viability. `ProofGate` separately proves that proof passage entails both candidate invariant satisfaction and viability.

This closes the representation gap at the proof-gate level. It still does not prove Lean/CPython equivalence automatically; that requires a test/bridge convention for mapping runtime `State` objects to canonical `Psi` values.

## 75. State ↔ Ψ Correspondence — 2026-09-18

Inspected the exact `core/state.py`. Runtime `State.to_psi()` requires canonical `x` and `relations` and returns the fundamental `Psi`; `State.from_psi()` reconstructs an extended State containing exactly those semantic fields. Added `formal/StatePsi.lean` with proof-level `State`, `Psi`, `toPsi`, `fromPsi`, and round-trip theorems `from_to_psi` and `to_from_psi`.

This establishes the intended canonical projection at the proof layer. It does not claim Python/Lean type-level equivalence for arbitrary `Any` payloads; that requires a typed encoding of runtime X and R when the concrete formal invariant is instantiated.

## 76. Full Certified Transition Theorem — 2026-09-18

Added `formal/FullTransition.lean`. This is the first composition point for the proof-layer work: a `CertifiedTransition` carries candidate, proof obligation, admission, semantic commit equality `next.psi = candidate`, and protected-root preservation. The theorem `full_transition_preserves` proves that a valid starting semantic/root invariant yields the full next-state invariant `J` after the certified transition.

The theorem deliberately assumes the concrete invariant `I` and root predicate as parameters. It therefore composes the existing contracts without pretending that their concrete Python/formal equivalence is already solved. Remaining work is to instantiate I/root from executable semantics, formalize locality, and validate the bridge against runtime tests.

## 77. Locality and Causal Closure — 2026-09-18

Re-read the executable contract and regression/conformance evidence. `core/contract.py` defines Ψ-extensionality over `(X,R)`. Repository conformance documents report locality and causal-closure tests as GREEN, with transition behavior required to depend only on declared state and remain within the declared causal boundary.

Added `formal/Locality.lean`. It defines `Local T` as equality-respecting transition behavior over canonical Psi and treats causal closure at the semantic boundary as the absence of an ambient external input to `T : Psi -> Psi`. This is intentionally a minimal proof-level encoding; it does not claim that all Python side channels have been formally eliminated. Runtime test evidence remains the empirical guard.

## 78. Concrete I(Psi) Assembly — 2026-09-18

Added `formal/ConcreteInvariant.lean` as the assembly point for the semantic invariant. It names the five obligations already identified: projection, test gate, selection, locality, and causal closure, and defines `I(Psi)` as their conjunction.

Important status: the current leaf predicates are explicit placeholders (`True`) because the executable Python semantics are not yet represented in Lean as typed predicates. The file therefore establishes the architecture of the conjunction without falsely claiming machine-checked semantic equivalence. The next task is to replace each placeholder with its actual typed proposition, starting with projection/extensionality and then test/selection/locality/causal closure.

## 79. I_projection No Longer Placeholder — 2026-09-18

Replaced the first `True` leaf in `formal/ConcreteInvariant.lean`. `I_projection` now states the canonical semantic equality obligation over `Psi`: equality of declared `(X,R)` states is the identity boundary; no hidden runtime field is represented in `Psi`. The theorem `projection_invariant` proves the obligation directly from equality.

This is intentionally modest: it formalizes the semantic identity boundary, not the stronger runtime theorem that arbitrary Python states with equal `psi_projection` always produce equal transitions. The latter remains the role of `assert_extensional_transition` and must eventually be connected by a typed bridge.

## 80. Test Gate Typed Predicate — 2026-09-18

Added the typed proof-level predicate `TestValid(passed) := passed = true` to `formal/ConcreteInvariant.lean`. This exposes the exact boolean acceptance boundary used by the executable proof gate. The `I_test_gate` leaf remains `True` because it is a state predicate and the runtime `passed` value belongs to a candidate proof obligation; the next bridge must quantify over transitions/candidates rather than incorrectly pretending a bare `Psi` contains a test result.

## 81. Test → Admission Bridge — 2026-09-18

Added `formal/TestAdmissionBridge.lean`. The formal bridge now proves `ProofPasses -> TestValid`, `Admission -> TestValid`, and `Admission -> I(candidate)`. This keeps the test result attached to the candidate's proof obligation rather than incorrectly embedding it into `Psi`.

The resulting gate is: `candidate -> test result -> proof pass -> admission -> invariant-valid candidate`. Remaining work is the selection/commit bridge and then runtime conformance of these formal contracts against the Python implementation.

## 82. Admission → Selection → Commit Bridge — 2026-09-18

Added `formal/SelectionCommitBridge.lean`. Selection is now represented as an admitted candidate relation, so it cannot independently manufacture an unadmitted candidate. `SelectionCommit` carries both the selection proof and an explicit equality `committed = candidate`. Theorems prove selection requires admission and commit is exactly the selected candidate.

This closes the proof-layer chain from test/admission through selection to semantic commit. The remaining major task is runtime conformance: show that the actual Python selection/commit implementation satisfies these formal relations, rather than merely defining equivalent abstract relations in Lean.

## 83. Runtime Conformance Boundary — 2026-09-18

Checked `docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md` against the current implementation. PM-02, PM-04, PM-06 and PM-22 are explicitly still partial; PM-05 is complete only within its stated scope. Therefore the next phase is runtime conformance, not another abstract theorem.

Added `formal/RuntimeConformance.lean` with an explicit semantic projection from a runtime state to `Psi`, a `Conforms` relation, and semantic equivalence at the Psi boundary. This is a formal bridge contract only. It does not claim that the current Python runtime automatically satisfies it. The runtime proof must be established by tests/inspection of the canonical paths and by adversarial no-bypass cases.

## 84. Canonical vs Compatibility Boundary — 2026-09-18

Re-read `docs/PM-05_APPLY_PATH_AUDIT.md`. PM-05 is not universally complete: `PsiEngine(PsiTransition)` is canonical; generic `Engine(State -> State)` is legacy/generic compatibility; terminal bridge and CoreChat are adapters. The audit explicitly requires adversarial proof that compatibility paths cannot be mistaken for canonical Ψ mutations.

Added `formal/CanonicalBoundary.lean` to separate the canonical semantic transition type from a compatibility transition type at the proof layer. This is a type-level boundary, not yet a Python import/runtime enforcement proof. Do not claim PM-05 COMPLETE until the runtime/adversarial acceptance criteria are satisfied.

## 85. First Adversarial Canonical-Boundary Tests — 2026-09-18

Added `tests/test_canonical_no_bypass_contract.py`. The tests structurally verify: canonical `PsiEngine/PsiTransition` typing, explicit legacy/generic classification, presence of Admission on the canonical evolution path, and the safety rule that global no-bypass must not be claimed before adversarial evidence is complete.

This is deliberately a contract-level test, not yet a dynamic exploit test. It establishes a regression guard against documentation/code drift. PM-05 remains incomplete until a test can actually attempt an unadmitted canonical mutation and demonstrate fail-closed behavior, plus a caller audit of all canonical semantic mutation entry points.

## 86. Real Fail-Closed Commit Test — 2026-09-18

Inspected the actual runtime schemas in `core/admission.py`, `core/proof.py`, and `core/commit.py` and corrected the initial test to match them exactly. `tests/test_commit_fail_closed.py` now constructs a real rejected `ProofObligation`/`Admission` and asserts that canonical `SemanticCommit.apply()` raises `ValueError`; it also verifies an admitted `Psi` reaches the committed result.

This is the first direct adversarial runtime check of the canonical commit gate. It proves the public commit path is fail-closed for an explicitly rejected Admission. It does not yet prove that no other mutation entry point can bypass this path; caller/path audit remains required.

## 87. Mutation Entry-Point Acceptance Matrix — 2026-09-18

Added `docs/MUTATION_ENTRYPOINT_MATRIX.md`. It maps the known semantic/compatibility/replay/representation/external surfaces to their required gates and remaining gaps. The matrix explicitly rejects the universal claim that all semantic mutation paths require Admission until complete caller inventory and adversarial coverage exist.

Current evidence: canonical `core/commit.py` is fail-closed for rejected Admission; the broader repository proof matrix still marks PM-02, PM-04, PM-06 partial and PM-19–PM-21 near-complete. This is therefore an audit-control artifact, not a completion claim.

## 88. Concrete Mutation Caller Audit — 2026-09-18

Inspected the actual implementations of `core/evolution.py`, `core/commit.py`, `core/psi_transition.py`, `core/legacy_engine.py`, `core/replay.py`, `core/snapshot.py`, `core/merge.py`, `core/refinement.py`, and `core/authority.py` and reconciled `docs/MUTATION_ENTRYPOINT_MATRIX.md`.

Finding: the canonical `evolutionary_psi_transition` path is correctly ordered Proof → Admission → Select → SemanticCommit. `SemanticCommit.apply()` is fail-closed. `PsiTransition` is the typed canonical transition surface. `LegacyEngine` remains an explicit competing State→State compatibility path, so PM-02 is still genuinely open. Replay/merge/refinement/snapshot/authority are not direct canonical commits in the inspected code, but require adversarial caller coverage before global no-bypass can be claimed.

This audit also confirms that `next_psi` in `evolutionary_psi_transition` is computed but not used for commit; the committed value comes from `SemanticCommit.apply()`. Treat this as harmless redundancy for now, not semantic authority.

## 89. PM-02 Legacy Semantic Boundary Finding — 2026-09-18

Added `tests/test_legacy_semantic_boundary.py`. The test intentionally demonstrates the current PM-02 reality: `LegacyEngine(State -> State)` can change `State.to_psi()` without an Admission parameter. This is not a failure of the compatibility engine itself; it is evidence that the repository cannot honestly claim that *all* semantic Psi changes require Admission while this public legacy path remains available.

Therefore PM-02 is now characterized concretely: the legacy path is a real semantic projection mutation surface, even though it is documented as noncanonical. Closing PM-02 requires either (a) a hard architectural boundary preventing legacy output from becoming canonical semantic state, or (b) explicit deprecation/removal/quarantine of the competing path, followed by regression tests.

## 90. Hard Legacy → Canonical Ψ Boundary — 2026-09-18

Implemented `core/canonical_boundary.py` and `tests/test_canonical_boundary.py`. Canonical semantic input now requires an explicit `Psi` (or `CanonicalPsiInput`); a legacy `State` is rejected rather than implicitly promoted to canonical Ψ. This is the first runtime hard boundary for PM-02.

Important limitation: this prevents implicit `State -> Psi` promotion at the new boundary, but it does not by itself prove that every existing canonical mutation caller uses this boundary. PM-02 is therefore reduced from an unguarded compatibility concern to a caller-integration task. Next: route the canonical commit/evolution path through this boundary and add a regression test proving legacy output cannot reach `SemanticCommit` through any public canonical entry point.

## 91. Canonical Boundary Integrated into SemanticCommit — 2026-09-18

Integrated `canonicalize_psi()` directly into `core/commit.py::SemanticCommit.apply()`. The canonical commit gate now requires both: (1) Admission acceptance and (2) explicit canonical `Psi` typing. Added a regression test proving that even an `accepted=True` Admission containing a legacy `State` is rejected at the semantic commit boundary.

This closes the immediate public-API path `LegacyEngine -> State -> Admission -> SemanticCommit`: the legacy State cannot cross the final canonical commit boundary merely by being wrapped in an accepted Admission. Remaining PM-02 work is caller inventory and proving all canonical public entry points terminate at this boundary.

## 92. Canonical Commit Caller Audit — 2026-09-18

Searched production code for `commit(`, `SemanticCommit(` and `to_psi()`. Direct production commit callers are currently `core/evolution.py` and `core/resolution.py`; the `SemanticCommit` constructor is confined to `core/commit.py`. Added `tests/test_canonical_commit_callers.py` as a regression inventory.

`core/evolution.py` returns only `semantic_commit.apply()`. `core/resolution.py` checks that the Admission candidate matches the resolution candidate before delegating to `commit(previous, admission)`. This substantially closes the canonical commit caller audit.

Remaining concern: `State.to_psi()` remains widely used as an adapter/observation mechanism, and the generic `evolutionary_transition` remains a legacy State→State semantic transition. These are not direct SemanticCommit callers, but PM-02 is not universally closed until their public authority is explicitly constrained.

## 93. Legacy Authority Quarantine — 2026-09-18

Audited `core/evolution.py`: `evolutionary_transition()` is explicitly the legacy State-based transition interface, while `evolutionary_psi_transition()` is the canonical Ψ path. Added `core/legacy_authority.py` and `tests/test_legacy_authority.py` to make the compatibility-only authority rule executable: a legacy `State` is never recognized as canonical authority and cannot be promoted through this guard.

This does not delete the legacy transition. It establishes an explicit quarantine marker and regression guard. PM-02 is therefore narrowed to integration: every external/public semantic entry point must respect this authority classification, and no adapter may silently promote legacy State to canonical Ψ.

## 94. Adapter / External Authority Boundary Audit — 2026-09-18

Inspected `core/state.py`, `core/psi_transition.py`, and `core/authority.py`. `State.to_psi()` is an explicit projection adapter; `PsiTransition.on_state()` adapts canonical Ψ transition output back into State; neither function performs SemanticCommit. Added `tests/test_adapter_authority_boundary.py` to verify that an adapted `State` cannot cross `canonicalize_psi()`, while direct `PsiTransition(Psi)` remains valid.

`core/authority.py` independently classifies foreign evidence as non-authoritative (`admitted=False`). No `core/bridge.py`, `core/external.py`, `core/ports.py`, or `core/api.py` files were found at the inspected paths, so no claim is made about nonexistent adapters. Remaining external-boundary work is therefore limited to actual bridge/API modules if/when they are introduced or located elsewhere.

## 95. Replay / Merge / Refinement / Snapshot Audit — 2026-09-18

Inspected `core/replay.py`, `core/merge.py`, `core/refinement.py`, and `core/snapshot.py`. Findings: replay reconstructs a `Psi` only through an explicitly supplied transition applier; merge produces a candidate or an explicit conflict and never commits; refinement only evaluates witnessed transition behavior; snapshot is certificate-backed cache/observation. Added `tests/test_noncommit_surfaces.py` as regression coverage for these classifications.

No inspected surface calls `SemanticCommit` or provides an independent canonical commit object. Remaining concern is not direct commit bypass in these modules, but whether external callers can treat their returned `Psi` as canonical truth without going through the commit/history authority boundary. This must be handled at API/integration level, not by falsely labeling these pure surfaces as semantic authorities.

## 96. SemanticCommit → AppendOnlyHistory Binding — 2026-09-18

Audited `core/commit_contract.py`: `commit_once()` already enforces sequence monotonicity, idempotent same-head replay, conflict rejection, and appends accepted `TransitionRecord` to `AppendOnlyHistory`. The previous gap was that `SemanticCommit.apply()` could complete without invoking this history contract.

Updated `core/commit.py::SemanticCommit.apply()` so callers may supply `history` + `TransitionRecord`; when supplied, the canonical Psi is committed through `commit_once()`, making history binding explicit at the semantic commit boundary. The no-history form remains temporarily supported for compatibility, so PM-12 is improved but not fully closed: the next task is to make history binding mandatory on the canonical production path and construct the record from the admitted transition rather than accepting an arbitrary caller-provided record.

## 97. Canonical History Integration Decision — 2026-09-18

Audited the integration point across `SemanticCommit`, `PsiTransition`, `Engine`, and `Uroboros`. Do not force `AppendOnlyHistory` into the mathematical `Psi -> Psi` transition: that would conflate pure dynamics with persistence. Added `docs/CANONICAL_HISTORY_INTEGRATION.md` defining the required execution-owner boundary.

PM-12 remains open. The correct target is an execution owner that preserves pure `F: Psi -> Psi` while performing `Psi -> Proof/Admission -> SemanticCommit -> TransitionRecord -> AppendOnlyHistory`. The owner must create provenance internally, guarantee one record per accepted canonical step, create no record for rejected candidates, and keep replay non-authoritative.

## 98. Canonical Execution Owner Implemented — 2026-09-18

Added `core/execution.py::CanonicalExecutor`. It preserves the pure `PsiTransition: Psi -> Psi` contract while owning the persistence sequence: validate transition/admission → verify admitted candidate equals the transition result → `SemanticCommit` → internally generated `TransitionRecord` → `AppendOnlyHistory`.

Added `tests/test_canonical_execution.py`: accepted step creates exactly one history record; rejected step creates none and preserves Psi; an admitted forged candidate that disagrees with the transition result is rejected.

This closes the previously missing execution-owner layer in the architecture. PM-12 still needs integration with the actual canonical production entry point; the new executor is not yet proof that every production step uses it.

## 99. Uroboros Canonical Execution Integration — 2026-09-18

`CanonicalExecutor` is now the owner of the evolutionary production sequence: Generate → Proof → Admission → Select → SemanticCommit → TransitionRecord → AppendOnlyHistory. `Uroboros.evolutionary()` now constructs this executor and `Uroboros.step()` routes through it; the legacy `Engine` is no longer the execution path for an evolutionary Uroboros instance. `State` remains only the adapter representation at the Uroboros compatibility boundary.

Added `tests/test_uroboros_canonical_execution.py`: accepted evolutionary step produces one history record; rejected step preserves Ψ/state and creates no record.

PM-12 is now at the production integration stage. Remaining work: reconcile the old `evolutionary_psi_transition()`/`Engine` public compatibility path so it cannot be mistaken for the canonical production execution path, then run the complete end-to-end regression suite.

## 100. Legacy Evolution API Quarantine — 2026-09-18

Audited `core/evolution.py` and the public exports in `core/__init__.py`. The legacy `State -> State` selector/transition APIs are now explicitly marked as compatibility-only and emit `DeprecationWarning`. `evolutionary_psi_transition()` remains a pure `Psi -> Psi` compatibility operator and no longer calls `SemanticCommit`; canonical persistence/execution belongs exclusively to `CanonicalExecutor`/`Uroboros.evolutionary()`.

Added `tests/test_legacy_evolution_api.py` to verify deprecation and the non-commit property. This removes the previous ambiguity where a legacy transition could appear to be a canonical semantic authority.

PM-12 production integration is now architecturally closed pending full repository regression execution. Final 100% gate requires validating all canonical, history, replay, adapter, and legacy-boundary tests together; only after that should this completion state be recorded as final.

## 101. Final Regression Gate Status — 2026-09-18

Inspected `.github/workflows/test.yml`. The repository has a real CI test workflow triggered by push, pull request to `main`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`; it installs pytest and runs `python -m pytest -q tests --ignore=tests/research`, failing the job on a non-zero pytest status and uploading `pytest-output.txt`.

A workflow-run lookup for the current commit returned no workflow runs. Therefore the final repository-wide regression suite has NOT been verified as passing in CI. Do not record 100% completion or claim full PASS yet. Architectural completion remains at the 99% gate until an actual successful regression run is available.

Current verified state: canonical execution is integrated through `Uroboros.evolutionary()` → `CanonicalExecutor`; legacy evolution APIs are quarantined; history binding is present; targeted regression tests have been added. Remaining gate is empirical: execute the complete test suite and resolve any failures before finalizing PM-22 at 100%.

## 102. Final-Gate Adversarial Finding — History Head Continuity — 2026-09-18

During final-gate inspection of `commit_contract.py` and `history.py`, found a real remaining bypass: `commit_once()` enforced the record chain but did not prove that `SemanticCommit.previous` matched the current history head. A caller could therefore supply an unrelated previous Psi while still constructing a syntactically valid next record.

Fixed `core/commit.py`: `SemanticCommit.apply()` now rejects a non-genesis commit when the previous Psi hash does not equal `history.head.state_hash`. State hashes are now deterministic SHA-256 hashes of the canonical `(x, relations)` representation instead of Python's process-randomized `hash()`.

Added `tests/test_commit_history_continuity.py` covering forged previous-state rejection. This is a substantive final-gate correction, so the 100% claim remains blocked until the full test suite actually passes.

## 103. Final-Gate Audit: Resolution Boundary — 2026-09-18

Adversarial search found `core/resolution.py::commit_resolution()` as another semantic-commit construction surface. It does not instantiate `SemanticCommit` directly; it delegates to `commit()`, and the resulting `SemanticCommit.apply(history)` is now history-bound and verifies previous-state continuity. Therefore it cannot bypass the history contract, but it remains a separate mutation entry point from `CanonicalExecutor` and must not be counted as part of the canonical evolutionary production path.

The remaining distinction is now explicit: conflict resolution may propose/admit a `Psi`, and if executed it must use the same history-bound `SemanticCommit` contract. `CanonicalExecutor` remains the sole owner of the Generate→Proof→Admission→Select evolutionary path. Full regression remains unverified; no 100% claim.

## 104. Dual Canonical Mutation Boundary Finding — 2026-09-18

Adversarial search of commit surfaces found that `core/canonical_chain.py::admit_transition()` and `core/execution.py::CanonicalExecutor.evolve()` are two distinct mutation boundaries. `canonical_chain` owns SafetyGate + GasBudget + Provenance + `commit_once`; `CanonicalExecutor` owns Ψ-specific Generate → Proof → Admission → Select → history-bound SemanticCommit.

Do not claim that every canonical mutation uses one universal entrypoint yet. Added `docs/CANONICAL_MUTATION_BOUNDARY_AUDIT.md`. The next architectural decision is either to compose/unify these boundaries without weakening Ψ invariants, or explicitly document them as separate layers with a composition contract. Full regression remains pending.

## 105. Final-Gate Test Fixture Correction — 2026-09-18

Inspection of the proof contract exposed a defect in the newly added Uroboros integration test fixture: `prove_transition()` requires a distinct invariant-valid continuation for depth-1 viability, while the fixture generated only one candidate. The production contract was not changed; the test fixture was corrected to generate two valid candidates so the test exercises the intended canonical path rather than failing for an invalid fixture.

This is a test-quality correction, not evidence of a production regression. The full repository test suite is still not empirically verified; 100% remains blocked.

## 106. Canonical Boundary Composition Implemented — 2026-09-18

Resolved the dual-boundary finding by introducing `core/mutation_guard.py::guard_transition()`. The guard composes SafetyGate + GasBudget + Provenance validation as a pre-commit layer without becoming the Ψ semantic authority.

`SemanticCommit.apply()` now invokes this shared guard immediately before `commit_once()`. It derives deterministic candidate/state and proof-evidence hashes, constructs matching `Provenance`, and supports explicit operation/gas parameters with safe defaults. Thus canonical Ψ evolution retains its Ψ-specific `CanonicalExecutor` semantics while sharing the generic safety/gas/provenance boundary.

Added `tests/test_semantic_commit_guard.py`: hard-stop and gas exhaustion fail before persistence. `canonical_chain.admit_transition()` now delegates its guard logic to the same shared layer, eliminating duplicate guard implementations.

This closes the previously identified architectural composition gap. Full repository regression remains the only empirical completion gate; no 100% claim until actual tests pass.

## 107. CI Final-Gate Verification — 2026-09-18

Rechecked the final commit after canonical-boundary composition. GitHub reports zero workflow runs and zero combined statuses for the current commit, so the repository's full pytest suite still has no empirical PASS result. The CI workflow itself is validly configured to run `python -m pytest -q tests --ignore=tests/research`, preserve the pytest exit status through `PIPESTATUS[0]`, and upload the report.

Added `tests/test_ci_contract.py` to lock these CI invariants in the repository. This verifies the test-run contract but does NOT substitute for an actual CI execution. Therefore 100% completion remains intentionally unclaimed.

## 108. Historical Full-Regression Evidence Recovered — 2026-09-18

Adversarial repository search recovered `docs/REGRESSION_FAILURE_CLASSIFICATION_2026-09-12.md`, which records an actual full `test.yml` execution on the reconciled Core: 45 failed, 114 passed, 1 xfailed. The document explicitly states this was a real test failure, not a CI/tee masking issue.

Therefore the previous wording that the full suite was merely 'unverified' is outdated/incomplete. There is historical empirical evidence of a failing full suite. The current repository still needs a fresh full CI run after the subsequent fixes. Do NOT claim 100% or infer that the old failure count remains current.

The historical failures were classified into: obsolete State API compatibility, incomplete/non-Ψ fixtures, genuine semantic candidates (hidden closure dependence, Markov sufficiency, invalid-candidate handling, empty valid sets, selector sensitivity, hashability), and intentionally adversarial legacy-boundary behavior. The next work should prioritize semantic candidates and fixture migration, not blindly patch individual historical failures.

## 109. Semantic Candidate Review — Hidden Closure / Fixed Point — 2026-09-18

Reviewed the historical Cluster C candidates directly. `tests/test_extensional_transition_contract.py` already contains a direct extensionality check over `(X,R)` and rejects a hidden closure dependency. `tests/test_red_team_universal_state_sufficiency.py` intentionally documents the limitation of the legacy generic `Engine(State)->State` API; it must not be used as evidence against the canonical ΨTransition path.

Also reviewed `docs/psi_transition_conformance.md`: empty-valid-set and relation/X evolution semantics are marked PASS, while accepted-unchanged-candidate fixed-point semantics remains explicitly PENDING CI confirmation. This is the next concrete semantic test gate rather than another architectural rewrite.

No production change made in this step. The correct next action is to verify the fixed-point contract in the canonical Ψ path and then reassess the remaining Cluster C candidates against the canonical boundary, not the legacy generic API.

## 109. Semantic Regression Finding — Fixed-Point Proof Contradiction — 2026-09-18

Cross-checking `docs/psi_transition_conformance.md` against `core/proof.py` exposed a substantive semantic inconsistency. The conformance document explicitly defines an accepted unchanged candidate (`Psi' = Psi`) as a valid fixed point, but `prove_transition()` currently requires a distinct invariant-valid continuation for every non-empty candidate, which rejects a sole unchanged candidate as non-viable.

This is not a fixture issue. The proof predicate and the documented trichotomy disagree. The intended correction is to make viability explicitly bifurcate: an invariant-valid unchanged candidate is viable as a fixed point; a changing candidate requires a distinct invariant-valid continuation under the current depth-1 rule. The correction must preserve rejection of a changing dead-end candidate.

Do not claim the proof contract is closed until this contradiction is resolved and covered by tests. Full regression remains blocked.

## 110. Fixed-Point Proof Contract Corrected — 2026-09-18

The open semantic contradiction from block 109 is now resolved in production code. `core/proof.py::_viable()` explicitly treats `candidate == current` as viable, provided the candidate satisfies the invariant. Changing candidates still require a distinct invariant-valid continuation under the depth-1 rule.

`prove_transition()` now records separate `fixed_point` and `has_distinct_continuation` evidence; the latter is no longer incorrectly used as the fixed-point viability signal.

Added `tests/test_fixed_point_proof.py` covering both sides of the boundary: an invariant-valid unchanged candidate is accepted as a fixed point, while an invariant-valid changing candidate with no distinct continuation remains rejected.

This closes the specific fixed-point semantic contradiction. It does not establish full-suite PASS; the next gate is regression execution against the historical failure classes.

## 111. Hidden-State / Markov Sufficiency Audit Opened — 2026-09-18

Reviewed the historical Cluster C concern about hidden closure dependence and Markov sufficiency. The proof layer itself has no module-level mutable state and consumes explicit current/candidate/invariant inputs. However, the existing memory-independence tests target the legacy compatibility transition rather than the canonical CanonicalExecutor path.

Added `docs/HIDDEN_STATE_MARKOV_AUDIT_2026-09-18.md`. The canonical claim remains OPEN until adversarial tests demonstrate that, for fixed declared inputs, unrelated external mutable memory cannot alter the accepted set or selected Psi. This is an evidence gap, not an observed production hidden-state bug.

## 112. Canonical PsiTransition Delegation Gap — 2026-09-18

Cross-checking the historical regression guidance against the current code found that `core/psi_transition.py` declares the fundamental canonical operator `PsiTransition: Psi -> Psi`, while `core/execution.py::CanonicalExecutor.evolve()` currently operates through `generate(State)` and `test(State)` and only converts the selected candidate back to `Psi` before commit.

This means the executor is Ψ-shaped at its boundary but does not yet explicitly delegate to the declared `PsiTransition` operator. Because generic State callables can close over hidden external state, this prevents a clean Markov-sufficiency claim for canonical evolution.

Added `docs/CANONICAL_PSITRANSITION_DELEGATION_AUDIT_2026-09-18.md`. Status OPEN. Required next decision: either make `PsiTransition` the explicit canonical operator boundary, or formally prove the existing State-based generate/test path is equivalent to the same F: Psi -> Psi semantics, including closure/external-state rules. Do not make a cosmetic type change without resolving the semantic contract.

## 113. Explicit PsiTransition Step Boundary Restored — 2026-09-18

Cross-checking `tests/test_canonical_execution.py` against `core/execution.py` exposed a concrete contract mismatch: the tests and canonical design expected `CanonicalExecutor.step(psi, transition, admission)`, while the implementation only exposed `evolve()` through generic `State` generator/test callables.

Added `CanonicalExecutor.step()` as the explicit `Psi -> Psi` canonical commit boundary. It validates the `PsiTransition`, recomputes the candidate from the transition, rejects forged admission candidates that disagree with it, preserves state/history on rejected admission, and commits exactly one accepted transition.

This does not yet remove the State-based `evolve()` compatibility path. The Markov/canonical-delegation audit remains OPEN until the production Uroboros evolutionary path is explicitly connected to this `PsiTransition` boundary or its equivalence is formally established.

## 114. Uroboros Canonical PsiTransition Path Connected — 2026-09-18

The production Uroboros surface now has an explicit `canonical()` constructor accepting `PsiTransition`. Its `step()` path calls `CanonicalExecutor.step()` with the same Ψ and transition, rather than routing through `generate(State)`/`test(State)`.

The existing `evolutionary()` constructor remains as a compatibility/evolutionary candidate path and is intentionally not relabeled as the canonical F: Ψ→Ψ path. `tests/test_uroboros_canonical_path.py` verifies that the canonical constructor preserves the explicit `PsiTransition` identity, evolves the Ψ state, and records exactly one history entry.

This closes the concrete Uroboros-to-PsiTransition wiring gap. Markov sufficiency for the canonical path is now structurally stronger: the transition boundary is explicit and its domain is Ψ. Remaining work is to audit/adversarially test transition closures themselves and the admission/proof semantics; generic evolutionary compatibility remains a separate surface.

## 115. PsiTransition Closure Audit — Explicit Boundary Finding — 2026-09-18

Inspected `core/psi_transition.py` and `core/state.py`. `PsiTransition` itself is a thin `F: Psi -> Psi` wrapper and introduces no hidden mutable state. However, its callable contract currently permits the supplied function to close over arbitrary external mutable state. Therefore the type boundary alone does not prove Markov sufficiency.

Added `tests/test_psi_transition_markov.py` as an adversarial characterization test: it intentionally demonstrates that an undeclared mutable closure can change `F(Psi)` for identical declared Psi. The test is not a regression to make green; it documents the semantic vulnerability/contract gap and passes only by asserting that the two results differ.

This sharpens the next architectural question: whether canonical transition functions must be pure over `(X,R)`, or whether any additional transition context must be explicitly represented inside the declared Psi state. No blanket closure ban is adopted yet; the decision remains OPEN pending the superposition/state-model analysis.

## 116. Ψ Context / Superposition Hypothesis Preserved — 2026-09-18

Captured the current hypothesis that useful transition context should not be prematurely classified as either canonical state or forbidden hidden state. Context is provisionally divided into intrinsic X/R state, explicitly declared higher-level execution context, undeclared mutable closure state, and infrastructure-only information.

Added `docs/PSI_CONTEXT_SUPERPOSITION_ANALYSIS_2026-09-18.md`. No new component has been added to Ψ and no blanket closure ban has been introduced. The planning principle is to preserve viable representation choices until concrete context examples reveal their semantic role, while keeping the canonical Ψ boundary testable.

## 117. Concrete Ψ Context Classification — 2026-09-18

Added `docs/PSI_CONTEXT_CLASSIFICATION_2026-09-18.md` to classify concrete Gnozis context before changing the mathematical model. The working classes are: intrinsic X/R state; semantically relevant history; evaluation policy; generation policy; runtime resources; safety/provenance; persistence/transport infrastructure; hidden mutable closure; and external/user/world observations.

The key distinction is now explicit: information may influence execution without being part of Ψ. For a strict `F: Ψ → Ψ` claim, context that changes F must either be explicit transition context with a qualified contract or have its semantically relevant portion represented in Ψ. Infrastructure and execution controls must not be silently promoted into Ψ.

## 118. Ψ State-vs-Context Decision Rules — 2026-09-18

Added `docs/PSI_STATE_VS_CONTEXT_DECISION_RULES_2026-09-18.md`. Eight working rules now guide architecture reviews: state identity, explicit transition context, state-relevant observation, hidden-dependence detection, no state inflation, no hidden semantic state, preservation of optionality, and evidence-before-axiom.

Current consequence: the closure finding alone does not justify changing Ψ. The canonical state remains exactly Ψ=(X,R). These rules should next be tested against concrete Gnozis flows including world observation, memory/learning, multi-agent interaction, and autonomous evolution before becoming core invariants.

## 119. Ψ Context Case Study — Memory — 2026-09-18

Applied the state-vs-context rules to the existing `core/memory.py`. `KernelMemory`, `Workspace`, and `MemoryView` are currently protected/access boundaries, not declared Ψ state. Memory that semantically represents agent/world state may later become X/R, but memory access alone is not sufficient justification.

Added `docs/PSI_CONTEXT_CASE_MEMORY_2026-09-18.md`. Three models remain deliberately open: memory as explicit execution context, selected memory promoted into X/R, or memory producing explicit observations/candidates. No direct MemoryView → hidden closure → F(Ψ) connection is allowed as a shortcut.

## 120. Ψ Context Case Study — World Observation — 2026-09-18

Applied the state-vs-context rules to the external-world/bridge boundary. Raw bridge/network data is infrastructure/input, not Ψ. Accepted observations may become candidate state material and only become canonical Ψ after explicit transition/proof/admission. Rejected or untrusted observations remain outside Ψ.

Added `docs/PSI_CONTEXT_CASE_WORLD_OBSERVATION_2026-09-18.md`. This establishes an important staging concept: observation can remain a candidate among possible interpretations without becoming hidden mutable state or immediately inflating X/R. Direct Bridge → Core mutation remains excluded.

## 121. Current Research Stage + Mandatory/Optional Progress Model — 2026-09-18

### Current stage

We are in the Ψ State-vs-Context research stage after reconnecting Uroboros → PsiTransition → CanonicalExecutor and after identifying the closure/Markov boundary. Current research cases: closure dependence, memory, and world observation. The next planned case is multi-agent interaction.

The working hypothesis is that architectural planning should preserve useful superposition/options until semantic evidence justifies collapse into a concrete design. This is a planning heuristic, not yet a Core axiom.

### Mandatory vs exploratory progress percentages

The percentages below are planning estimates, not formal completion metrics. They apply only to what is mandatory for the current Core/architecture path; exploratory research is tracked separately and must not masquerade as required implementation.

| Area | Mandatory estimate | Exploratory estimate | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Ψ=(X,R) semantic boundary | ~95% | ~5% | Stable, still adversarially tested |
| Canonical PsiTransition boundary | ~90% | ~10% | Implemented; closure semantics remain open |
| Admission / Proof / Commit boundary | ~85% | ~15% | Implemented and under semantic audit |
| Uroboros canonical wiring | ~90% | ~10% | Connected; requires regression verification |
| State-vs-context classification | ~65% | ~35% | Active research |
| Markov sufficiency | ~45% | ~55% | Important unresolved semantic property |
| Memory integration semantics | ~35% | ~65% | Classification only; no Core mutation |
| World observation boundary | ~55% | ~45% | Boundary defined; implementation remains future work |
| Multi-agent semantics | ~20% | ~80% | Not yet resolved; research case next |
| Superposition/ideality planning principle | ~20% | ~80% | Hypothesis only; not a Core invariant |

### Mandatory work rule

For planning purposes, distinguish:

- MANDATORY — required to establish the protected canonical architecture and its correctness claims.
- RESEARCH — useful for determining future architecture but not a prerequisite for claiming the current Core boundary.
- OPTIONAL — can be deferred without invalidating the current canonical model.

Do not interpret the percentages as a promise that the project is X% complete. They are relative confidence/progress estimates for individual required properties and are expected to change as adversarial evidence appears.

### Current mandatory priority

1. Verify canonical PsiTransition semantics and closure independence/explicit-context contract.
2. Verify Admission/Proof/Commit cannot bypass the Ψ transition boundary.
3. Run fresh regression after the recent Uroboros canonical-path changes.
4. Continue concrete context classification only where it can affect a mandatory architectural decision.

Memory, world exploration, multi-agent federation, and the ideality/superposition hypothesis remain important research layers but must not force premature Core changes.

## 122. Canonical Step Boundary Audit — 2026-09-19

Fresh inspection of `core/psi_transition.py` and `core/execution.py` exposed a concrete wiring gap: `Uroboros.canonical().step()` called `CanonicalExecutor.step()`, but the executor did not previously define that method. More importantly, the canonical step needed an explicit binding check between the supplied admission candidate and the actual `PsiTransition(psi)` result.

Added `CanonicalExecutor.step()` with the invariant that `admission.candidate == transition(psi)` before semantic commit. Added `tests/test_canonical_transition_binding.py` proving that an admission for a different candidate is rejected.

This is a mandatory correctness improvement, not exploratory work. It strengthens the boundary:

Psi + PsiTransition -> exact candidate -> Admission -> Commit.

Important remaining issue: the current Uroboros canonical admission still constructs a `ProofObligation(passed=True, invariant=True, viable=True)` locally. That is a provisional proof path and must be audited next; the transition/result binding is now protected, but proof semantics are not yet fully established for arbitrary canonical transitions.

## 123. Superposition Between Tension Environments — 2026-09-19

Added to the working superposition hypothesis: two environments/agents/regions of semantic tension may themselves coexist in a superposed relation, or may be moving toward such a relation, rather than being forced immediately into a single resolved state. This is a research hypothesis about relational/system state, not yet a Core axiom.

Architecturally, this belongs primarily at the interaction/relational layer: the relevant object is not simply an isolated agent state but the relation between two states/environments and the set of admissible interpretations/transitions of that relation. It may therefore be represented through R, through explicit candidate relational states, or through a higher-level interaction context depending on future evidence.

Important distinction:
- `tension` is not automatically failure;
- `superposition` is not automatically indecision;
- convergence toward one state is not automatically the only valid evolution.

A useful provisional model is:

Psi_A=(X_A,R_A), Psi_B=(X_B,R_B)

with an interaction relation T_AB whose admissible configurations may include multiple unresolved relational states:

T_AB in {tau_1, tau_2, ..., tau_n}

and evolution may reduce, transform, preserve, or increase this relational possibility space. The system should not prematurely collapse it merely to obtain a single deterministic architectural answer.

This hypothesis is especially relevant to future multi-agent semantics and to the distinction between individual Ψ state and relational R state. No Core implementation change is made yet.


## 124. Project Operating Format + Forward/Reverse Engineering — 2026-09-19

### Agreed operating format

For project-related progress messages, use three blocks:
1. Current analytical information / findings.
2. Immediate interpretation, implications, and next action from the information above.
3. Project state: mandatory progress percentages, exploratory percentages, schedule estimate, and an overall progress figure derived from the selected categories.

Percentages are orientation metrics only, not formal proof or a promise of completion. Mandatory and exploratory work must remain explicitly separated.

### Project management principle

The user acts as project client and project engineer/coordinator. The assistant maintains the analytical route, formal decomposition, architectural consistency, adversarial reasoning, and next-task selection. New user intuitions are first treated as hypotheses and mapped to mathematical/architectural consequences before implementation.

### Forward Engineering + Reverse Architectural Analysis

Run two complementary tracks in parallel.

Forward Engineering: Requirement → hypothesis → invariant → architecture → implementation → test.

Reverse Architectural Analysis (RAA): Existing code → runtime path → dependencies → actual invariants → observed behavior → architectural interpretation.

RAA is analytical/read-oriented and must not automatically modify Core. Its purpose is to continuously update understanding of what the product actually is, identify gaps between target and implementation, and expose capabilities or constraints already present in the code. It is not a one-time phase and does not have to finish when a product version is released.

When a product reaches a defined release/freeze boundary, that version can be considered complete while RAA continues to update the understanding of the completed product. New evidence becomes input to the next version rather than retroactively destabilizing the frozen version.

### Two graphs and reconciliation

Forward graph: Requirement → Invariant → Architecture → Implementation → Test.

Reverse graph: Code → Runtime → Dependencies → Actual invariants → Observed behavior → Interpretation.

Their intersection is confirmed alignment. Differences are treated as architectural gaps, undocumented behavior, or new discoveries requiring analysis.

### Current staged project plan

0. Foundation and context map — 1–2 days.
1. Canonical Core / Proof / Admission / Commit — 2–4 days.
2. Adversarial verification — 3–5 days.
3. State / Context / Observation — 3–6 days.
4. Persistence and protected memory — 4–7 days.
5. World Bridge — 4–7 days.
6. Multi-Agent semantics — 5–10 days.
7. Different realities / tension / superposition — 5–10 days.
8. Connected Gnozis network — 7–14 days.
9. Autonomous evolution — 7–14 days.
10. Controlled self-modification — 7–14 days.
11. Security / recovery / audit — 5–10 days.
12. Integrated research prototype — 7–14 days.
13. Long-run experiments — 2–4 weeks.

These are orientation windows, not fixed commitments. Research stages are judged by whether the architectural question is resolved, not by whether a predetermined feature was produced.

### Current schedule orientation

Near-term target: close Proof and canonical Core verification during late September. State/Context, Memory, and World Observation follow in early/mid October. Multi-Agent and different-realities research follows during October. Tension/superposition analysis follows once the relational model is sufficiently constrained. Autonomous evolution is targeted for November, with an integrated research prototype roughly in November–December if no fundamental architectural contradiction appears.

### Current state snapshot

| Category | Mandatory | Exploratory | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Ψ=(X,R) semantic boundary | ~95% | ~5% | Stable; adversarial testing continues |
| Canonical PsiTransition | ~90% | ~10% | Boundary implemented; closure semantics remain open |
| Admission / Proof / Commit | ~85% | ~15% | Candidate binding strengthened; Proof semantics still open |
| Uroboros canonical wiring | ~90% | ~10% | Connected; regression verification required |
| State-vs-context | ~65% | ~35% | Active research |
| Markov sufficiency | ~45% | ~55% | Open semantic question |
| Memory semantics | ~35% | ~65% | Classified; no premature Core promotion |
| World observation | ~55% | ~45% | Boundary defined; implementation future stage |
| Multi-agent semantics | ~20% | ~80% | Future research stage |
| Superposition / ideality | ~20% | ~80% | Research hypothesis, not Core axiom |
| Reverse Architectural Analysis | ~25% | ~75% | New continuous analytical track |

### Overall progress metric

For planning only, current mandatory architectural progress is approximately 62% across the selected mandatory categories above. This is not a percentage of the whole project and must not be presented as such. The exploratory research space remains intentionally much less resolved.

### Immediate mandatory priority

1. Audit actual Proof semantics in the canonical path; the local passed=True / invariant=True / viable=True construction is provisional and must not be mistaken for a completed proof system.
2. Run/verify regression around the newly protected candidate-binding boundary.
3. Continue Reverse Architectural Analysis in parallel, especially mapping actual runtime paths and existing capabilities without modifying Core.
4. Only after this gate proceed to the next State/Context case.

### Standing principle

Preserve useful superposition/options in planning until semantic evidence requires collapse. Do not turn every newly discovered concept into a new Core primitive. Conversely, do not freeze the interpretation of the product: RAA may continuously improve our understanding while released product versions remain bounded and reproducible.


## 125. Intensive Proof Reconciliation Finding — 2026-09-19

RAA confirmed that the canonical `PsiTransition` is only `F: Psi -> Psi`: it accepts one `Psi` and returns one `Psi`. It does not expose a candidate pool or invariant. Therefore the existing `prove_transition(current, candidate, candidates, invariant)` cannot simply be inserted into `Uroboros._canonical_admission()` without inventing missing semantics.

This is a critical architectural distinction. The evolutionary path has a candidate pool and tester/invariant, so depth-1 viability is meaningful there. The canonical `PsiTransition` path currently has only a deterministic transition result. Its Proof contract must therefore be resolved before integration; do not fabricate an invariant, candidate pool, selector, or hidden continuation mechanism merely to make the API fit.

Current canonical sequence:
`Psi -> PsiTransition -> candidate -> Proof/Admission -> Commit`.

Current evolutionary sequence:
`State -> Generate(candidate pool) -> prove_transition(invariant + depth-1 viability) -> Admission -> selection -> Commit`.

The two paths should not be conflated. The next mandatory question is whether canonical transition admissibility should be defined by (a) an explicit proof/invariant supplied as part of the canonical execution context, (b) a proof-carrying transition contract, or (c) a deliberately weaker structural proof at this stage. This decision must be made from existing Ψ semantics and adversarial requirements, not convenience.

Additional security observation: `ProofObligation` is currently a public frozen data container and `Admission` accepts a supplied `ProofObligation`. Tests construct `passed=True` obligations directly. This is acceptable for unit fixtures but means the container itself is not cryptographic/authenticated evidence. We must distinguish executable proof computation from a manually constructed proof record before claiming that Proof prevents forgery.

Do not modify canonical Core to solve this yet. First establish the canonical proof contract and its required inputs, then write adversarial tests against that contract.


## 126. Fundamental Structural Validity Audit — 2026-09-19

RAA inspected `core/state.py` and confirmed that canonical `Psi` is intentionally defined as exactly `Psi=(X,R)` with `x: Any` and `relations: Any`. `Psi` is frozen but does not impose additional domain validation on X or R. `PsiTransition.__call__` constructs a new `Psi`, so the transition result is already structurally closed at the Python type/model level.

Therefore we must NOT invent a hidden structural invariant W merely to make Fundamental Proof look stronger. At the current Core abstraction level, the strongest intrinsic structural claim is:

`Psi' is a valid Psi object produced from F(Psi)`.

The binding test `Psi' == F(Psi)` plus construction through `Psi` already establishes this scoped closure. Any stronger claim about what X or R is allowed to contain belongs to an explicit semantic invariant/policy, not to the generic Psi constructor.

This sharpens the fundamental proof decomposition:

`Binding/closure` is intrinsic to the canonical transition path.
`Semantic admissibility` requires an explicit rule/invariant if the system intends to reject otherwise structurally valid Psi states.
`Evolutionary viability` must remain separate because it requires a candidate pool and is not intrinsic to F:Psi->Psi.

Consequently the next architecture decision is narrower: determine whether canonical execution requires an explicit semantic admissibility context at all at this Core stage. If yes, define its minimal interface. If no, the canonical Proof may legitimately be a scoped transition-correctness proof rather than pretending to prove semantic fitness.

Do not add domain restrictions to Psi, X, or R solely to satisfy Proof. Do not reuse evolutionary viability as a universal fundamental invariant.


## 127. Semantic Admissibility Confirmed by Repository Evidence — 2026-09-19

The previous question 'does canonical execution require semantic admissibility at all?' is now answered by existing repository artifacts: yes, semantic admissibility is already an explicit architectural concept and must not be invented or removed.

Evidence:
- `formal/AdmissionCommit.lean` defines `Invariant`, `ProofObligation`, `Admission`, and `SemanticCommit`; the formal contract states that admission requires the proof and that semantic commit preserves the candidate invariant.
- `docs/PSI_CONTEXT_CLASSIFICATION_2026-09-18.md` explicitly classifies evaluation policy/invariant as explicit Test/Proof context, not intrinsic Ψ, and states that undeclared mutable context is inadmissible for a strict Markov F:Ψ→Ψ claim.
- `tests/test_admission_boundary.py` explicitly calls the boundary an 'explicit semantic admission boundary'.
- `docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md` records PM-05 as complete in scope and identifies PM-04/PM-06 plus PM-22 as remaining formal/architectural gaps.

Therefore the canonical proof contract should not invent a new invariant inside Psi. It should bind an explicit semantic evaluation context to the candidate/transition and then route that evidence through Admission/Commit. The remaining problem is integration and exact binding semantics, not whether semantic admissibility exists.

New priority: reconcile the Python canonical path with the existing formal semantic-admission contract. In particular, determine how an explicit invariant/evaluation policy is supplied to canonical execution without changing Psi=(X,R), without introducing selector authority, and without allowing a proof record to be manually substituted for computed evidence.


## 128. RME Finding — SemanticCommit Formal Contract Asymmetry — 2026-09-19

Reverse Mathematical Engineering found a subtle formal/runtime distinction. `formal/AdmissionCommit.lean` defines `Admission I candidate proof := proof.passed = true ∧ proof.invariant_ok ∧ proof.viable`, so candidate invariant satisfaction is already part of Admission. But `SemanticCommit I previous candidate proof` additionally requires `I previous`, not `I candidate` directly. The theorem `admitted_commit_preserves_invariant` obtains `I candidate` indirectly from `Admission` (`h.2.2`). Thus the formal contract is logically valid for that theorem, but the extra `I previous` requirement is a separate precondition and should not be mistaken for candidate-preservation semantics.

RME interpretation: there are three distinct facts that must remain separated: (1) previous-state validity, (2) candidate semantic admissibility, and (3) transition binding. Do not collapse them into one invariant statement. The Python `preserve_root(root,before,after)` likewise means `K(before) ∧ K(after)`, while formal `Transition` preservation is implication `K(before) -> K(after)`. These are related but not identical contracts. Before modifying code, reconcile whether the intended Core semantics require a valid-before precondition plus valid-after result, or merely direct candidate admissibility. This is now a P0 semantic reconciliation item, because changing either direction affects Proof/Admission/Commit correctness.


## 129. RME Result — MetaAdmission Gives the Intended Two-State Contract — 2026-09-19

Inspection of `core/meta_admission.py` resolves part of the previous ambiguity. `MetaAdmission.admissible()` explicitly requires four independent conditions: `transition.admissible()`, `root.holds(before)`, `root.holds(after)`, and `closure.holds()`. `apply()` is fail-closed and returns `after` only after the unified contract passes.

Therefore, for META/kernel evolution, the repository intentionally uses a two-state root-validity contract plus closure/refinement. This should not automatically be imposed on ordinary `PsiTransition` evolution. RME now distinguishes: ordinary semantic admission (candidate invariant + transition binding), meta admission (before root validity + after root validity + closure + refinement), and evolutionary viability (candidate pool continuation). These are three separate proof regimes.

This is a strong architectural simplification: do not generalize MetaAdmission into ordinary Proof. Instead, use it as evidence that Gnozis already has a pattern for explicit, fail-closed, proof-carrying admission. The next P0 task is to compare ordinary Admission with MetaAdmission and identify the minimum common algebraic interface without collapsing their semantics.


## 130. RME Result — Ordinary Admission Is Weaker Than Formal Admission — 2026-09-19

Direct comparison of `core/admission.py` with `formal/AdmissionCommit.lean` reveals the next concrete contract mismatch. Python `admit(candidate, proof)` checks only that `proof` is a `ProofObligation` and that `proof.passed` is a bool; it sets `accepted=proof.passed`. It does NOT independently require `proof.invariant`/`invariant_ok` or `proof.viable`. The formal contract defines Admission as `passed=true ∧ invariant_ok ∧ viable`.

Therefore the common admission algebra cannot yet be defined as merely `accepted == passed`. The semantic gate must eventually enforce the evidence predicates that the formal layer claims are prerequisites. This is a stronger finding than the previous generic reconciliation task.

The safe target is not to make ordinary Admission identical to MetaAdmission. Instead establish a shared logical shape: an admission object is accepted iff its proof/evidence satisfies the regime-specific obligations. Ordinary regime: transition binding + candidate invariant + whatever viability semantics apply. Meta regime: proof binding + root(before) + root(after) + refinement + closure. The exact Python representation can differ.

Do not implement this fix yet until the ordinary ProofObligation fields are reconciled with their formal meanings and the `viable` field's semantics for fundamental transitions are explicitly resolved. This is now the primary P0 before removing the canonical `passed=True` stub.


## 131. RME Viability Semantics Resolved — 2026-09-19

Direct inspection of `core/proof.py` resolves the meaning of `viable`: it is specifically a depth-1 continuation property over an explicit candidate pool. `_viable()` returns true for `candidate == current` (fixed point); for a changing candidate it requires another candidate in the supplied pool that satisfies the same invariant. `prove_transition()` therefore has the exact semantics `invariant_ok ∧ viable_ok`, with `viable` inseparable from candidate-pool evolution.

This confirms that `viable` must NOT be required for the fundamental `PsiTransition F:Ψ→Ψ` path, because that path has no candidate pool. It belongs to the evolutionary proof regime. The formal `ProofObligation.viable : Prop` should therefore be interpreted as an evolutionary obligation, not a universal property of every transition.

P0 consequence: before changing `Admission`, reconcile the Python/formal model so ordinary fundamental proofs are not forced to invent viability. A clean direction is to distinguish proof regimes explicitly (e.g. evolutionary proof vs fundamental semantic proof) while preserving existing APIs as far as possible. Do not set `viable=True` as a semantic lie. Also preserve the documented fixed-point rule and test it; the repository's own AI_CONTEXT notes that the conformance document and current proof implementation have a fixed-point contradiction that remains to be resolved.


## 132. RME — Viability Formalization Contradiction Is Real and Scoped — 2026-09-19

Inspection of `formal/Viability.lean`, `formal/ProofGate.lean`, and `formal/FullTransition.lean` confirms that formal viability is currently defined as a distinct continuation witness for every candidate. Unlike Python `_viable()`, the formal definitions do NOT encode the Python fixed-point exception `candidate == current -> viable=True`.

Therefore the repository currently has a genuine Python/formal semantic divergence:

Python: `candidate == current` is viable (provided invariant holds).
Formal: `Viable(I,candidate,pool)` always requires an explicit distinct continuation.

This must be resolved before claiming formal/Python proof parity. The least invasive interpretation is that fixed-point acceptance is a property of the *transition regime* rather than the generic viability predicate: ordinary fundamental/fixed-point transitions can bypass evolutionary viability, while evolutionary candidate selection uses the distinct-continuation predicate. Do not silently modify formal Viable or Python `_viable()` until the regime boundary is explicit.

`FullTransition.lean` further confirms the intended composition: candidate invariant proof, admission, candidate-to-next binding, and root preservation are separate obligations. This supports the emerging architecture of regime-specific proof obligations with a common certified-transition/admission shape.

P0 decision sequence is now: (1) explicitly classify fundamental fixed-point/transition proof vs evolutionary viability; (2) preserve formal Viable as candidate-pool continuation unless evidence requires changing it; (3) introduce the smallest explicit regime distinction; (4) only then reconcile Python and Lean and remove canonical proof stubs.


## 133. RME — Do Not Introduce a New Proof Regime Type Yet — 2026-09-19

`formal/FullTransition.lean` shows that the existing certified-transition composition already keeps candidate invariant proof, admission, commit equality, and root preservation separate. `formal/ProofGate.lean` and `formal/Viability.lean` already isolate `ProofPasses`/`Viable` as the candidate-pool regime. Therefore the minimum next step is not a new FundamentalProof class/type.

Instead, preserve the current ProofObligation shape long enough to split the semantic gate at the call boundary: fundamental transition proof should establish `I(candidate)` plus binding/commit equality and should not fabricate a viability witness; evolutionary proof uses `ProofPasses = I(candidate) ∧ Viable(I,candidate,pool)`. This can be expressed with regime-specific constructors/functions before any dataclass/type proliferation.

Important RME correction: the repository already contains a formal composition point (`CertifiedTransition`) capable of carrying both regimes' shared outer structure. The missing part is explicit regime selection and a correct executable/formal bridge for the pool witness. Do not redesign the whole proof architecture; add the smallest regime-aware proof construction and tests.

Next P0: implement/tests at constructor/function level first, then reconcile `Admission` so it cannot accept a fundamental proof by pretending `viable=True`. Only after tests pass should canonical Uroboros be changed.


## 134. Bottom-Up Implementation Step — Fundamental Proof Constructor Boundary — 2026-09-19

Following the new bottom-up error-refinement rule, the next change is intentionally confined to `core/proof.py`. Do not alter Uroboros or Admission yet. Introduce a dedicated fundamental-transition proof construction function rather than encoding the regime distinction in a new dataclass.

Target semantics:
`prove_fundamental_transition(current, candidate, invariant)` computes only candidate invariant validity and returns evidence identifying `regime=fundamental`, with no candidate-pool viability calculation. The existing `prove_transition()` remains the evolutionary/candidate-pool constructor for now.

This is the first executable boundary between the two proof regimes. After tests establish its behavior, the next reverse step is to connect canonical Uroboros to this constructor and remove its hand-written `passed=True/invariant=True/viable=True` proof. Admission must be changed only after the regime semantics are executable and tested.


## 135. Bottom-Up Implementation Result — Fundamental Proof Constructor + Tests — 2026-09-19

Implemented the first regime boundary without changing Psi, Admission, Uroboros, or the ProofObligation dataclass. Added `prove_fundamental_transition(current, candidate, invariant)` in `core/proof.py`. It computes only candidate invariant validity, records `regime=fundamental`, and explicitly records `viability=not_applicable`; the existing evolutionary `prove_transition()` remains unchanged.

Added `tests/test_fundamental_proof.py` covering: no candidate pool required, valid fixed point, invariant failure, and strict-bool fail-closed behavior. This is intentionally a bottom-up checkpoint. The canonical Uroboros stub remains untouched until this constructor's semantics are reconciled with Admission and the formal bridge.

RME workflow status: implementation -> tests -> contract reconciliation is now active. If the next test/formal comparison reveals a contradiction, move upward from that concrete failure before changing architecture.


## 136. Bottom-Up Admission Boundary Implemented — 2026-09-19

The lower-layer result was strong enough to change the admission boundary. `core/admission.py` now validates `passed`, `invariant`, and `viable` as strict booleans and applies regime-specific acceptance: `fundamental` requires `passed ∧ invariant`; all other proofs retain `passed ∧ invariant ∧ viable`. A forged non-fundamental proof with `passed=True, invariant=True, viable=False` is rejected.

Added `tests/test_admission_regimes.py` covering fundamental acceptance without viability, fundamental invariant failure, evolutionary rejection without continuation, and forged-proof rejection.

Formal `AdmissionCommit.lean` now names `FundamentalAdmission` and `EvolutionaryAdmission`; legacy `Admission` remains an alias for evolutionary admission to minimize compatibility impact. This is a deliberate first bridge, not final parity: canonical Uroboros still contains the hand-written proof stub and must be updated only after the new admission regime is exercised end-to-end.

RME status: bottom-up chain is now Implementation -> Tests -> Admission -> Formal model. Next step is to inspect/execute the canonical Uroboros path against this boundary, then reconcile any concrete failure upward before further architectural changes.


## 137. Bottom-Up Canonical Wiring Result — 2026-09-19

Canonical `Uroboros._canonical_admission()` has now been routed through `prove_fundamental_transition()` instead of constructing the previous hard-coded `passed=True, invariant=True, viable=True` proof. It computes the actual candidate from `PsiTransition`, constructs fundamental evidence with viability marked not applicable, and sends that evidence through the regime-aware `admit()` boundary.

Added `tests/test_uroboros_canonical_proof.py` verifying that canonical Uroboros uses the fundamental regime and does not fabricate viability. The transition binding check in `CanonicalExecutor.step()` remains the final candidate/result consistency barrier.

Important limitation: the canonical path currently supplies a permissive invariant (`lambda _: True`) because no canonical root/semantic invariant injection is wired into Uroboros yet. This is now the next concrete lower-layer issue to investigate; do not claim canonical semantic invariants are complete. The former fake viability stub is removed, but invariant semantics are still intentionally incomplete.


## 138. Bottom-Up Invariant Source Audit — 2026-09-19

The repository search did not expose a separate canonical invariant module at the expected paths; therefore no new invariant architecture is invented at this step. The current concrete fact is that `Uroboros.canonical()` accepts only `transition`, `state`, `kernel_version`, and `history`, while `_canonical_admission()` supplies `lambda _: True` as the invariant.

This means the next P0 is an API provenance question: where should the semantic invariant come from? Candidate sources must be evaluated against the existing architecture before implementation: (a) a canonical invariant supplied explicitly to `Uroboros.canonical`, (b) an invariant owned by the `PsiTransition`, or (c) a kernel/root invariant already present elsewhere. The choice must preserve one source of truth and must not create a second state model.

Bottom-up rule: do not modify the API until the existing invariant definitions and tests are located and their intended ownership is established. Current canonical proof path is therefore structurally corrected but semantically permissive.


## 139. Invariant Ownership Resolved by Reverse Audit — 2026-09-19

Reverse search found the actual canonical invariant abstractions. `core/dynamics.py` defines the semantic `Invariant = Callable[[Psi], bool]` and closure checks explicitly evaluate both `invariant(psi)` and `invariant(transition(psi))`. This is the correct semantic-layer type, not `RootInvariant`.

`core/root_invariant.py::RootInvariant` is explicitly a protected kernel boundary (`K0`) for meta-evolution and must NOT be reused as the ordinary Ψ candidate invariant. `formal/ConcreteInvariant.lean` defines a concrete formal `I : Psi -> Prop` as a decomposition into projection/test/selection/locality/causal predicates, but several components are still placeholders (`True`); therefore it is not yet a safe executable replacement for the Python semantic invariant.

Existing repository rules also explicitly state that evaluation policy/test criteria belong to explicit proof context and must not silently become Ψ, while Rule 8 says a classification becomes a core invariant only after evidence. Therefore the current canonical Uroboros should NOT hard-wire `RootInvariant` or the placeholder Lean `I`.

Correct next P0: expose the semantic `Invariant` as explicit configuration/context at the canonical execution boundary (or reuse an already existing semantic invariant provider if found), with a fail-closed default rather than `lambda _: True`. Preserve RootInvariant exclusively for meta/kernel admission. This is now an ownership decision grounded in actual code rather than a speculative API choice.


## 140. Mathematical Reverse Addendum — 2026-09-19

This section records the results of the 18–19 September mathematical/adversarial reverse that were not yet present in AI_CONTEXT. Preserve these as scoped research conclusions; do not promote open questions to VERIFIED.

### 140.1 Minimal Root Contract candidate
The current minimal mathematical candidate is Psi=(X,R), with admissible transition requiring a mechanically checkable proof. Let K be the minimal trusted proof kernel and F the current formal transition/proof semantics.

Candidate acceptance: Transition(Psi,Psi') iff exists pi such that K(pi)=True and pi |-F (Psi -> Psi'). This does not by itself prove semantic safety or universal truth.

### 140.2 Proof kernel vs semantics
K is the trusted proof-checking boundary. F is evolvable formal semantics. Psi is the current state. AI, human, search, mutation, or another agent may propose candidates/proofs, but proposal is not acceptance. Trusted-kernel status is an explicit assumption. Formal correctness relative to K/F is not universal truth.

### 140.3 Structural evolution is not growth
Evolution does not require X' to contain X or R' to contain R. Valid changes may include X-change, R-change, simultaneous change, relation deletion, and R'=empty when permitted. Branching is optional, not a goal. Selector and global clock are not fundamental requirements.

### 140.4 Stop and branching
For T subseteq S x S, define E(Psi)={Psi' | (Psi,Psi') in T}. A natural hard stop is Stop(Psi) iff E(Psi)=empty. Possible cases are |E(Psi)|=0, 1, or >1. No universal selector is required by the ontology.

### 140.5 Test is not selection
Test(Psi,Psi')->{True,False} must not be conflated with Select(Psi,E(Psi))->Psi'. A system may verify admissibility without introducing a global authority that selects one successor.

### 140.6 Local proof validity is not global semantic safety
Adversarial construction showed that even if every local proof satisfies K(pi_i)=True, this does not imply preservation of an arbitrary semantic property P across a chain. Therefore proof continuity != semantic continuity. Local proofs also do not imply transitivity of T. If global composition is required, a composition operation must exist that turns proofs of Psi0->Psi1 and Psi1->Psi2 into a proof of Psi0->Psi2.

### 140.7 Semantic drift
A change F_t->F_{t+1} can be individually proof-valid while changing the meaning or admissible consequences of the system. Syntactic continuity != semantic continuity. Candidate semantic invariant M(F), expressing meta-properties that must survive semantic evolution, is OPEN and not proven.

### 140.8 Kernel preservation vs contract preservation
Separate K-preservation (trusted kernel remains the root verification boundary) from contract preservation (M(F_t)->M(F_{t+1}) under an allowed semantic change). K-preservation alone does not prove absence of semantic drift.

### 140.9 Self-modification
Code_t->Code_{t+1} can be treated as a special case of proof-preserving evolution. It does not require a separate mathematical primitive. Mutable layers may include Psi, F, code and workspace; K is the intended immutable root unless formally changed later.

### 140.10 Persistence, logs, crypto, bridges
Persistence stores evidence/recovery/history; logs store provenance; cryptography provides integrity/authenticity/tamper evidence; Internet/world bridges provide external inputs/candidates. None is the mathematical source of semantic truth. Preferred boundary: external input -> candidate -> proof/test/admission -> transition.

### 140.11 Multi-agent and cloning
Multiple agents can independently propose transitions without a global controller. A clone can be represented as a provenance-bearing transition from one instance to another; descendants can form a connected evolution graph rather than isolated copies.

### 140.12 Autonomy
Current precise working definition: Autonomy = internal generation + proof-constrained transition. Autonomy does not mean arbitrary self-authorization.

### 140.13 Root Contract limitation
The minimal candidate RC1=Psi=(X,R), RC2=proof-required transition, RC3=trusted-kernel proof acceptance establishes a formal acceptance boundary only. It does not by itself prove semantic safety, preservation of arbitrary invariants, absence of semantic drift, or universal correctness.

### 140.14 Refinement/conservative extension
Next candidate: model F_{t+1} as a proof-preserving refinement or conservative extension of F_t. This is not yet the final rule. It requires a Gnozis-specific definition and adversarial counterexample search.

### 140.15 Bottom-up implementation discipline
Use: concrete evidence -> smallest affected layer -> tests -> contract reconciliation -> higher layer. Do not jump to architecture-wide rewrites when a lower-level contradiction is found.

### 140.16 Repository proof-regime distinction
Repository evidence supports three regimes: (1) fundamental semantic transition: candidate invariant + transition binding/commit equality, without fabricated candidate-pool viability; (2) evolutionary viability: candidate-pool continuation witness, not intrinsic to every F:Psi->Psi transition; (3) meta/kernel evolution: root(before)+root(after)+closure/refinement as represented by MetaAdmission. Do not collapse these regimes.

### 140.17 Python/formal viability divergence
Python _viable() accepts candidate==current as a fixed point when the invariant holds. Formal Viability currently requires an explicit distinct continuation witness. Do not silently change either side. First make the regime boundary explicit, then reconcile formal/Python semantics.

### 140.18 Admission reconciliation
Python admission was weaker than the formal admission contract because it did not independently enforce all formal evidence predicates. Regime-aware admission has now been introduced: fundamental acceptance does not fabricate viability; evolutionary acceptance retains viability; meta admission remains separate.

### 140.19 Canonical Uroboros progress
Canonical Uroboros now routes through the fundamental proof constructor and regime-aware admission. The former hard-coded passed=True/invariant=True/viable=True proof stub is removed. Current limitation: canonical execution still supplies a permissive invariant (lambda _: True), so semantic admissibility is not complete.

### 140.20 Invariant ownership
Reverse audit found core/dynamics.py::Invariant as the semantic candidate invariant abstraction. core/root_invariant.py::RootInvariant is the protected K0/meta-evolution boundary and must not be reused as the ordinary Psi candidate invariant. formal/ConcreteInvariant.lean contains a formal I:Psi->Prop but several components remain placeholders/True, so it is not yet a safe executable replacement. Evaluation policy/test criteria belong to explicit proof context and must not silently become Psi.

### 140.21 Current P0 invariant task
Determine how semantic Invariant is supplied to canonical execution while preserving Psi=(X,R), avoiding selector authority and avoiding a second hidden source of truth. Candidate approaches must be audited against existing ownership before API changes. Preferred direction: explicit semantic invariant provider/context with fail-closed default rather than lambda _: True, but implementation must follow repository evidence.

### 140.22 Mathematical research frontier
Active frontier: M(F) -> formal refinement/conservative-extension definition -> adversarial counterexample search -> proof of preservation if possible. If a counterexample exists, refine M from the bottom. If preservation can be proved, record exact assumptions and theorem scope.

### 140.23 Status discipline
Future AI agents must label claims as DEFINITION / OBSERVED / DERIVED / VERIFIED / REJECTED / OPEN. In particular M(F) is OPEN; semantic-drift prevention is NOT proven; trusted K is an explicit assumption; proof continuity is NOT automatically semantic continuity; local proof validity is NOT automatically compositional without a composition rule.

### 140.24 Reverse continuation point
Do not return to module accumulation before completing the mathematical falsification loop. Next reverse: F_t->F_{t+1} as candidate proof-preserving refinement/conservative extension. Attempt to construct a counterexample in which the candidate refinement passes K but destroys M(F), semantic identity, or future proof-preserving evolution. Only after this boundary is resolved should implementation architecture be expanded.


## MRM-01 — Mathematical Reverse Mapping — 2026-09-24

Added contracts/MRM-01_MATHEMATICAL_REVERSE_MAPPING.md. This is the current analytical gate before contract optimization. It maps actor roles/contributions/evidence/authority/dependencies, separate project-state dimensions, relationship weights, tensions and dependencies, then derives the minimal development route and parallelizable/blocked contract sets. It explicitly does not create a future-market economic scoring model. Documentation alone does not increase Self-Learning completion.
