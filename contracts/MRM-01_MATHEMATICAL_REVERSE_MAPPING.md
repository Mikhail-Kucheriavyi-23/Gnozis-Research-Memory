# Mathematical Reverse Mapping Contract — MRM-01

**Date:** 2026-09-24  
**Status:** ACTIVE — analytical, evidence-gated  
**Purpose:** mathematically map the current Gnozis ecosystem, its participants, project-state dimensions, dependencies and tensions before optimizing the next execution contracts.

## 1. Principle

This contract does **not** build a mathematical economy or assign permanent economic value to participants.

It creates a minimal formal reverse map:

`CurrentState + Actors + Contributions + Constraints + Evidence -> DevelopmentGraph`

The output must be sufficient to determine which contracts can proceed in parallel, which are blocked, and which missing invariants must be implemented before the next transition.

## 2. Actor model

For actor `i` record:

`A_i = (Role_i, Contribution_i, Evidence_i, Authority_i, Dependencies_i)`

Actors are evaluated by their role and verified contribution within a contract graph, not by personal worth or a global ranking.

Candidate classes include owner, developer, AI platform, auditor, researcher, partner, tester, user, external service, independent Core and future agent.

## 3. Project state vector

Maintain separate dimensions rather than collapsing maturity into one score:

`G = (K,L,C,P,A,I,M)`

- `K` Core integrity/completeness
- `L` Self-Learning evidence
- `C` Contract maturity
- `P` Provenance
- `A` Authority/security
- `I` Integration readiness
- `M` Market readiness

Every value must be backed by repository evidence, tests, CI evidence, or an explicitly marked UNVERIFIED/THEORETICAL state.

## 4. Relationship weight

For a relationship between actors/domains `i,j`:

`W_ij = f(Evidence, Authority, Dependency, Risk, Contribution, ContractStatus)`

The result is a dependency/trust/permission map, not a political, personal or financial ranking.

## 5. Contract transition

Every proposed development transition must be representable as:

`S_t -> S_(t+1)`

with Preconditions, Contract, Required Evidence, Acceptance criteria, Dependencies, and Rollback/failure condition.

No roadmap step is credited as implemented merely because it is documented.

## 6. Tension reverse map

For each material contradiction:

`Tension -> Constraints -> CandidateProposals -> Verification -> SelectableTransition`

Hard constraints remain non-negotiable. Optimization occurs only inside the permitted solution space.

## 7. Contribution provenance

Where contribution hashing is applicable:

`Contribution -> Evidence -> Hash -> Parent/Dependency Graph -> Verified Result`

A contribution hash is evidence of provenance, not an automatic claim of legal ownership, future value or revenue.

## 8. Parallelism rule

Contracts may execute in parallel only when their dependency sets do not require an unverified predecessor:

`CanParallel(C_i,C_j) = Dependencies(C_i) ∩ Blockers(C_j) = ∅`

Shared mutable boundaries, authority issuance, schema migrations and other non-commutative operations require explicit sequencing.

## 9. Required output

The reverse analysis must produce:

1. Actor Weight Map
2. Project State Vector
3. Contradiction/Gap Map
4. Dependency Graph
5. Parallelizable Contract Set
6. Blocked Contract Set
7. Minimal next-state route
8. Evidence gaps preventing stronger conclusions

## 10. Acceptance

MRM-01 is complete only when the route can explain **why** each next contract is required, what it depends on, what evidence will close it, and which contracts can proceed concurrently.

No single global percentage may substitute for this map.

## 11. Next

After MRM-01 reaches VERIFIED status, optimize the existing contract registry against the resulting dependency graph. Do not introduce a new economic scoring system before this reverse map is complete.
